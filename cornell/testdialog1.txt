unwelcome.
state trooper.
how'd you get a tux at the last minute.
this from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips.
you know fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives. it means we've become spectators. bianca still lets me play a few innings. you've had me on the bleachers for years. when you go to sarah lawrence i won't even be able to watch the game.
right.
what plan.

what are you saying.
i believed in you
oh. so you are a new man.

the men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
did you ever turn tricks before.
so you were never a prostitute.
do you have coffee.
do you really want me to forget about you.
did you get a report from the m.e.
maybe you don't care about that either. prettiest suspect i've had in awhile.
what would you call her.
eastern europe. like what. romania. hungary.
you're polish.
she just saw two of her friends killed. they probably threatened her.
why not.
what would your girlfriend think of that.
i took her there for a shower and that's it.
well it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not. don't you understand that's why you're a professional.
we don't know that yet. it's much too early. there's a lot to be done.
i really can't give out any information right now at this point.
he was hurt but not seriously. he'll be fine.
do you have the suspect in custody.
stop it.
maybe i should just ya knowturn to the cameras and say do you mind if we just work something out.
you're ruthless.
look at this. you have blood on your shirt. whose is it.
well that's great.
sooner or later that's everybody.
keep them out of my way.
okay. you ready.
we are both from prague.
whore.

i told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape.

it's easy to learn.
viewer discretion advised.
alright. go ahead.
no way. he's mine.
okay you're under arrest. now you happy.
you seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
but doesn't the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes.
what's up.
i suppose so. though of course there's a more sinister explanation.
just ask hal. it's conceivable they might keep something from us but they'd never keep anything from hal.
well that's something.
yes i know.
i'm sorry about the misunderstanding hal.
too bad about frank isn't it.
i'm goin to do this myself hal. let me have the control please.
i know that you've had that on your mind for some time now dave but it would be a crying shame since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and i have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
continued
yes i know that sweetheart.
okay sweetheart. well i have to go now. tell mommy that i called.
yes daddy.
oh that's such a delightful age.
well gregor and i will look forward to seeing you.
oh i really don't have time for a drink. if it's all right i'll just sit for a minute and then i've got to be off.
well as it happens i'm on my way up to the moon
yes and i'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the i.a.s. convention.
fortunately they did.
we're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. is there anything we can do for you.
maybe you better have a black russian.
now how's your memory doin'.
excuse me baby but if i don't get some action tonight i'm gonna bust. you interested.
hey don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on.
you're gonna help us take him.
i got hit. i can't believe it. i got shot.
i don't give out the details.
well.
i been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. all those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge
half a million.
where's the money.
i wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw luther. you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once not twice jack.
you missed luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. made a phone call.
tell me something. why didn't you just take the money off luther and split.
it's late they're closing
what if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit. i mean they could be in rio de janeiro.
okay reggie start bustin' my chops tell me how great you were with that chick.
i want to be left alone on this one. algren was killed with my gun.
but that's what you say about all of us all the tine we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it

i don't think your gun's loaded
great place for lunch.
the number what's the goddamn number.
hard man to live with.
shut up.
how hot are they.
you sure.
five bills.
look at all these little things so busy all of a sudden. notice how each one is useful. what a lovely ballet so full of form and color. so full of.life.
what are you doing.
there was this guy with a limp who came a month ago.said he was an art dealer asking all these questions about the sacred stones.at the time i didn't think anything of it. what was his name. i'm so bad with names
eto akta gamat.

major dallas if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the federal army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
learning language.
here we go again
why. we did pretty well wouldn't you say.
like love
i have thousands of memories but none of them are mine there is no need for me other than this. i'm immortal but i have no life.
uh.
this is all that survived.
sounds like a freak of nature to me.
the compositional elements of his dna chain are the same as ours there are simply more of them tightly packed. his knowledge is probably limitless.
the-stones weren't aboard the ship.
right away sir. i'll send you a new one to the hotel.
what's wrong. are you alright.
you owe me an explanation. you can't treat me like this.
the loop. the girl we did what the fuck do you think i'm talking about. this guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop
flattering. and who's your colorful little chum.
and the other performer it has to be that monster you use the man in the mask.
machine.
you remember mr. longdale don't you.
don't let longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. if his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you you'll be just as dead and so will max.
 sorry
celebrity films.
what.
tell me what happened.
what do you want to know. you saw it you saw the loop
where. show me where.
you are a private investigator.
that's trust. mr. christian trusted me implicitly.
except you're willing commit murder with them.
isn't it incredibly obvious.
give me the film.
i'm not a cop.
child pornography.
there's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal. foot fetish shit films watersports bondage spanking fisting she- males hemaphrodites it's beyond hardcore but legal. this is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up another guy looks at it and falls in love. now with some of the s+m and bondage films they straddle the line. how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not. step over that line you're into kiddie porn. rape films but there aren't many. i've never seen one.
you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
you can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb. so what. am i gonna go off and be a race car driver. go to harvard. run for president. what about you pops.
nothing illegal it's always borderline. like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a
oh come on man what are we doing in this flea bag.
you don't need to be here.
mister welles. you're very prompt.
have a pleasant evening. will you have tea mister welles.
there was nothing he could do. my husband left everything to me. i prevented anyone from seeing the contents. i felt these were my husband's private things. i didn't i didn't realize
please believe me. this is probably a stag film. simulated rape. hard to stomach and it might seem real but there are ways of making it look realistic fake blood and special effects
okay
one was for two hundred thousand one dollar and thirteen cents. another was for three hundred thousand six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents
okay.
if there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about tell me but i have to ask. your husband he committed suicide.
what are you talking about .
they brought her into the room one man he put a knife to her throat and he raped her
he raped her andandand he murdered herhe cut her up with knifes
yes i remember mary
no sir he is not.
yes mister welles thank you.
excellent. we accept mastercard and american express.

sounds like a game show host to me.
how'd you learn so much about dreams.
we have matching luggage.
no
tell him i was looking for him okay. i'm dan.
so what's up. what'd i miss.
what is it.
i'll tell you later.
frankly dear we wondered what you intend to do with our baby.
we know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
dad.
it was just an accident. like with dan.
and so is your baby. you've got more than just yourself to think of now.
i thought about that.
where are you going.
you too.
how is he - .
peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit. show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars and <u>i'll</u> show you an idiot.
you've asked why i stay a bachelor. there goes the best reason i know.
i guess skipper neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the academy didn't he.
but <u>they're</u> not skipper neilsen's son. it broke his heart. then when some newspapers called carl 'the honest sincere son of a war-mongering father' - captain neilsen resigned from the navy. oh he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'lungfish' - but it broke him all the same.
a mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo.
why do you say that.
now they feel itdown below.
under <u>water</u>.
all ready.
remove your weapons commander. and come here - alone.
why.
well i'll be - .
this is maybe worse than you and i are used to. what i'm talking about i'm talking about murder. among other things.
evan twombley the union boss who got shot. somebody murdered him.
you don't believe me.
what is the northcountry development association.
no not exactly. i'll look at the divorce decree see if we can get it redrawn. interview your daughter. jill right.
nope. heard it. we wasn't far apart. i spotted this buck then i heard the gun go off and twombley was gone. i looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was deader'n shit. called it right in.
lawyer. i don't need no lawyer do i.
yeah.
double a. new britain.
where'd twombley get shot.
yeah.
on your sleeve.
saw him do it.
there's your old twenty-gauge and that there's the new browning you was showing me last night. this must be twombley's gun. brand new. very fancy tooling. probably fired one time. it's a beautiful piece of work. but what the hell jack i guess you deserve it. right's right.
yeah.
to us it was.
why. why not. you know these kids from when you went to school here. it hasn't been that long.
no what.
see i knew you'd be mad.
that's all you got to say. yes.
c'mon we can always sneak a big mac. and a cherry turnover. your favorite. what do you say.
you can't have nothing jill. we need lunch. mr. pizza.
nothing i guess. i guess i can wait till we get home. maybe we'll stop by wickham's for a hamburger when we get to lawford. that suit you. you always like wickham's.
okay.
you're a policeman.
jill please it's alright. nothing happened.
i figured you already heard.
sorry about the long lunch. my clutch is going out again.
he say anything about the summons i tried to give him. sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
did you see that sonofabitch in the bmw. he could've killed somebody.
lots of people. guy like evan twombley boston union official probably got lots of people want to see him dead. the government's been investigating his links with the mafia.
there's another thing i've been thinking about. i don't know how you feel about the idea margie because we've never talked about it. but i've been thinking lately i've been thinking we should get married sometime. you and me.
i've been thinking about it that's all.
you've been married twice 
it was to the same woman. i was just a kid it's not like a marriage proposal or anything just a thought. something for you and me to talk about and think about. you know.
it's broke i guess. there's an electric in the bedroom.
whitehouse. next time phone ahead.
moving violation. i just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket. now. are you nuts. is that it whitehouse. you're nuts.
don't give me a hard time mr. gordon. i'm just 
the sign. it looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
jillie you want a cheese grilled sandwich.
his office. you mean my old office.
well i guess that's what he said.
where's ma.
why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed.
love. what the fuck do you know about love.
bang.
i get to feeling like a whipped dog some days rolfe and some night i'm going to bite back. i swear it.
anyone else want one. rolfe.
i want to let the gas run out. i don't want the bastard driving drunk and he's always drunk now. after we'll hide the keys.
not particularly.
i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop. i was a careful child and i became a careful adult but at least i wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
wade are you alright.
mom just this once give it a rest.
i know but lotsa times i feel like it's me versus the world. some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in bangladesh. i mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
i don't drink coffee.
mr. president it's an honor. now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
just stay on my wing sir. i'll take you all the way in.
sir you threw out page two.
remarkable aircraft. remarkable.
how.
not even close. hell we can't even make syria or iraq.
you don't know the half of it. did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation. we could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
and all these rooms here.
now or he dies please.
leave my daughter alone.
yes
shall i begin by executing the president's daughter. she's right here.
you got what you wanted. you going to release us now.
over my dead body.
get `em ready. you come with me.
i'll not going without my family.
how do you know she understands. you haven't spent more than five minutes with her or me in weeks.
someone should give you a raise.
white house switchboard. how may i direct your call.
sir the president does not call this particular number. so whoever you are get a life before i have this call traced.
okay if you're the president when's your wife's birthday.
thank you for calling the white house
you wanna knock of f.
it's bait. don't take it.
sir the speaker of the house attacked this administration on national television. you can't afford to leave that hanging.
my god. i think that was a mig.
what's the story.
yes it did. mr. dunn can i ask you a personal question.
but ted the invitations have already gone out.
elaine we have to go back.
simon i'm going to check rok's secondary readout unit.
can't we change course.
i don't think we have any alternative captain.
no more kids yelling 'your old man's a thieving rapist'.
okay joey. the doc says you gotta relax. this hospital in des moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
joe the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids. you bought auto insurance not life insurance.
poached <u>and</u> over captain oveur. over.
you're tired striker overworked. that wiring meets all the safety specifications.
excuse me are you alright. i noticed you talking to yourself. i'm a nurse. can i be of some help.
you've been hurt.
people change in relation to each other. love changes on its own.
sure. but that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
well to tell the truth they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. just told me to pick up captain kramer.
that's right.
a hospital. what is it.
no.
all right. unless i can get all these people to a hospital quickly i can't even be sure of saving their lives. now is there anyone else on board who can land this plane.
look you'll be back in town tomorrow night. we'll have dinner talk it over.
it's the truth. what's hurt you the most is your record since the war. different cities different jobs and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
i love you elaine.
is it. because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
i wish i could say the same for george zipp.
but ted you're the only
we'd better get back now.
you promise you'll write.
good-bye darling. i love you. i love you darling.
oh i can't stand it.

mr. striker the passengers are ready.
the young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
yes
the guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till but i don't think that's what they were there for. i think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands george
agree to work with me. you don't like me you don't like any of us. you have nothing but contempt for us. and yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner
but i .
tell me.
matthew you don't have to .
i don't think i could ever learn to read that shit. how long did it take you to learn english.
which one is that. raw what.
i'll bet. would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two.
ss'loka'. it means literally small but intelligent creature. it loses much in the translation.
they had months in quarantine to develop the plan. porter with his chemistry background must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug. hubley manufactured it at the refinery. strader through the nightclub established a distribution network. and harcourt
if the drug is here we must destroy it.
no he's not. not if he overdosed on the drug. massive amounts trigger a a change. your body functions seize up you appear to be dead but it's really a state of incubation. when you emerge you're
i never thought i'd say this but for once in my life i think i'm willing to wait for back-up.
we think he could'a been involved yeah. you know him.
who else can i ask around here.
what.
does that look at all suspicious to you.
you got your vest.
hey 'top.' what's the op.
i've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis. it seems to be metabolizing. he should wake up soon.
that is the question of the hour. we could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. an ant of termite colony for example is ruled by a single female a queen which is the source of new eggs.
that's it. see it. emergency venting.
how long until it blows.
it's going to be closer. you better get going.
you did okay bishop.
you read my depositionit's complete and accurate.
i get the picture.
if you go. it's a second chance kiddo. and it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it. you gotta get back on the horse
yello. oh ripley. hi
you never said anything about an android being here. why not.
well i meani know this is an emotional moment but let's not make snap judgments. let's move cautiously. first this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it 
this is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. we can't just arbitrarily exterminate them 
don't make me pull rank ripley.
corporal hicks.
those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division. now if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes. set up for life.
i expected more of you ripley. i thought you would be smarter than this.
the corner. ready.
oh man. and i was gettin' short too. four more weeks and out. now i'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock. it ain't half fair man.
i don't care how. think of a way. think of something.
fifteen meters.
terrible.
well some kids can't handle it like you can.
gone.
newt. newt wake up.
are we going to sleep now.
good morning.
and he's been commissioned to write an opera. is it true.
no.
a turkish brothel.
oh. well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
oh - excuse me.
yes sir that's the truth. but don't blame him. the fault is mine. i was too indulgent with him. but not again. never again i promise. i implore you - let me bring him back here. i'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
and how will you make him keep it.
no your grace. i mean with all humility no. i would rather you dismissed me. it's obvious i don't satisfy.
yes.
go ahead tell him. tell them all. they won't understand you anyway.
do you think that's funny.
no no. say it backwards shit-wit. sra-i'm-sick say it backwards.
no this is serious. say it backwards.
well i'm not borrowing any more money from my mother and that's that.
well don't do that again.
i don't know.
stanzi-manzi i'll put it in your hand.
why not.
no. don't answer it.
frau mozart.
how charming. but why did he not come himself.
would it be too much trouble sir to ask you to look at them now. while i wait.
no sir. this is my own idea.
tomorrow night i dine with the emperor. one word from me and the post is his.
how much will you pay him.
not at all.
what a strange young man.
just one year.
i think it is an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna majesty. it should really infuriate the archbishop beyond measure - if that is your majesty's intention.
you already commissioned an opera from mozart.
majesty i don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
she's very tired poor creature. you know me: i'm a real pig. it's not so easy cleaning up after me.
they say you're in debt.
how many.
you don't have secrets from me.
why didn't you mention it in your letters.
thank you. that'll be fine. don't spend any money on me.
thank you. are you well today fraulein lorl.
yes.
are you herr mozart.
well.
animals.
i'm serious. you write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs i'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. mind you it'll have to be in german.
look i asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
i'm afraid i am.
if a man cannot earn he must borrow.
did you like it then.
really. why.
oh i could kill him. i mean really kill him. i actually threw the entire opera on the fire he made me so angry.
i think you overestimate our dear viennese my friend. do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap.
would you stay with me while i sleep a little.
oh. have i seen it.
what is what.
kapellmeister bonno count orsini- rosenberg and court composer salieri.
mozart -
sire only opera can do this. in a play if more than one person speaks at the same time it's just noise. no one can understand a word. but with music with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. isn't that marvelous.
so.
well.
of course. the man you accuse yourself of killing.
and do they believe it.
what.
you mean that play.
bravo your majesty.
how sad. it's tragic isn't it. such a talent.
that lady is back sir.
oh yes. he's just exhausted. he became dizzy that's all. we should let him rest.
and say everything went wonderfully. a triumph-de-luxe - say that. tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
i'll call tomorrow.
yes doctor.
did he say a wolf.
yes sir.
i dream of death mostly.
how old are you.
twenty-eight.
david. where on earth have you been
david please be rational. let's go to dr. hirsch.
he's playing a stupid joke sir.
david don't lose control.
well all right then be that way. here swallow this.
take these round now will you please. the american boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. will you be sure of that.
nothing quite as dramatic as that miss price. he just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. he suffers from nightmares. i'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
oh all right. there was this airplane over the atlantic on its way to new york. it was full of men from the united nations.
yes but does everyone kill bambi.
hello david. i am dr. hirsch and this is a countryman of yours mr. collins.
do you think she'll meet me in rome.
she's a jerk.
you're talking about the woman i love.
we've known debbie what since the eighth grade. how many years of foreplay is that.
i assume full responsibility.
nice looking group.
listen at least it's warm in here.
ask them what the candles are for.
i don't know. now that we're out here and it's three degrees i'm not so sure i wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
i heard that.
come on where.
walk away jack.
where are we going.
debbie klein cried a lot.
david.
we were attacked by a werewolf.
what.
you're not real.
yes.
what about the zoo.
well even if i'm not the wolfman i am crazy enough to do something like that. i mean here i sit in leicester square talking to a corpse. i'm glad to see you jack.
i could hang myself.
excuse me. yes.
no.
no thank you.
tom i never had trouble getting credit from you before. when i was flat broke you gave me all the money i wanted. now i come to you with a swell deal and the greatest—
yes - sure—

i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.

hmm.
i beg your pardon.

you are a hell of a woman.

i understand. but again in all honesty i was not informed.
i don't agree. the negro middle class does exist and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
go on. good so far.
exactly.
so what. we would just give the naacp a donation that would be the end of that. no such thing as bad publicity. so what. earlier you said singing and dancing.
that's exactly my point. has he even directed actors before in anything.
this has to be a big mistake.
good woman. i trained her right.
how did you end up here.
so he drank himself into a stuper.
the point being that him the networks don't want black people on television unless they are buffoons.
you getting cold feet.
you okay.
what would their reaction be. i hadn't the foggiest.
is that good or bad.
how long have you and hambone been hangin' out.
that's the way it came out. let me ask you one question. have you ever been in want in need your entire privileged life.
can i kiss you too.
you feel good not nervous.
mantan we got a show to tape.
son peerless is your name. now you might be one of these hollywood types change your name and all that but peerless dothan is on your birth certificate.
regardless he still is your father.
even more reason to see him. he'll be overjoyed with your success.
i'm doing okay. been reading about your show it's all over everywhere. i watched it's all over everywhere. i watched it once. i thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
yes i have very hard. has daddy called.
helsinki which is the capital of finland.
finland.
ahhh i never heard of that term before. i thought you were black of african-american. no.
how did you get this gig.
yes you.

gots no intention of ending up broke.
what.
just ask me what you want to know.
aw c'mon.
forget about me are you a puppet for dela.
upon my word sir i think you have acted very coolly.
i had news of you in dublin. faith you've begun early like your father's son but i think you could not do better than as you have done. but why did you not write home to your poor mother. she has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in dublin.
there's only six miss dugans now poor dorothy.
the coward.
your honor must lower his voice.
perfectly so; and what is more i will tell you that i love her and that i am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
then you have never loved. your heart is empty.
then i will respectfully take leave of her.
you will do as you please. it seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other. do you not agree.
i hate miss clancy you know i do. and i only danced with her because because the person with whom i intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
oh. i can dance with you any day and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner. besides roderick captain best's a man and you are only a boy and you haven't a guinea in the world.
yes for i wish to entertain splendidly.
was he cheated.
i have good news for you mr. cosgrove. the firm of bracegirdle and chatwick in the city of london are prepared to lend you 20000 pounds pledged against your interest in the edric mines. they will redeem the encumbrances against the property which amount to some 10000 pounds and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. they will lend you the 20000 pounds against the lease income which they will apply to the loan as it comes in and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill. are you serious.
yes of course.
your bother is in america fighting the rebels.
the milkmaid's daughter.
sir william cosgrove with his complication of ills was dying before us by inches. he was continually tinkered up by doctors and what with my usual luck he might be restored to health and live i don't know how many years. if cosgrove would not die where was the use of my pursing his lady. but my fears were to prove groundless for on that very night patient nature would claim her account.
i beg your pardon.
charming schuvaloff.
what do we do.
what about you wandering around alone. at least we have an alibi 
right. now i'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more okay.
that'd be my reaction too 
is that what i did now. and of course you can prove all of it.
we can prove that you're not ray dunbar. impersonating a fellow cadet is a court-martial in and of itself 
ohhhh i don't think so
how do you know that.
jesus what happened.
so you killed him.
right.
oh come on 
that's exactly what he says about you.
you saw west right. how was he killed.
full clip to the body 
they.
a test will no doubt link you to the killing 
i've done nothing wrong. i'm the victim here.
levi i don't know if you're familiar with investigative work but we have this little thing called motive and you just gave yourself one.
i don't know 
been better. i read about what's been happening with you i should have called 
was dead right. you think dunbar's on the level.
it was so good i actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. the base commander. the one in control. you couldn't let him testify could you.
that's preposterous 
i didn't mean that as a compliment.
hurricane knocked out our mainframe so all we have are their dogtags. cadets raymond dunbar and levi kendall 
you really want to make banal chit- chat like that now.
you do understand that there's absolutely no way i could ever be attracted to you right.
i plan to grow on you.
why do you care.
this isn't the time 
because he'd shot mueller.
but you didn't see it right.
you and dunbar got your stories straight. little details little inconsistencies designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other asking questions killing time until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where senator daddy can protect you. you think you're just going to slide out of this. you're an accessory to murder levi you're going to jail 
thank god
we all know what you did pike. i don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here but

i don't really know much but bits and pieces. i hear things. my room is right above my father's office. the ear there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear and it did come off a living person. that's direct from the coroner's office. the person is unknown. there are a couple of cases i get mixed up on but i think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. i heard some of the same names.
still it must be kinda rough.
i don't know.
i'd like to talk to you about something.
it wouldn't hurt to hear the plan i guess.
i don't know it sounds like a good daydream but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
first of all we'll have a nice dinner. try to find out where dorothy sings.
that sounds good.
i'm going to wait here until she comes.
okay thanks.
that's for me to know and for you to find out. i'll see you. i mean call you okay.
well how did it go. what happened.
he got a little jealous.
ok. it's a strange world sandy. this is what i have found out. what i think i have found out. dorothy vallens is married to a man named don. they have a son. i think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named frank who has now cut off both of don's ears. i think he is holding them to make her do things for him. i think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. i call him the yellow man. you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. i don't know what he does but i think he's on drugs supplied by frank. frank is a very dangerous man.
that doesn't bother you does it.
can i give you a kiss good night.
you want to go talk to him.
shoot.
you didn't tell him about me.
it's good to see you.

do not kill do not rape do not steal. these are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
there are varying degrees of evil. we urge you lesser forms of filth not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption into our domain.
okay just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is
and number three dolly.
the what man.
new hitman wants to leave his mark
that's a possibility. y'know you boston cops are perking up. that's two sound theories in one day neither of which deal with abnormally sized men. another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
what about one guy with two guns.
brilliant. so now we got a huge guy theory and serial crusher theory. top fucking notch. what's your name.
but he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well been up the waitress' skirt all night poor girl.

inez this is 
she's from cuba.

after that my parents never let me go to dignan's again.
so when you were saying bob's at the store and acting real surprised that was just an act. you were just 
i understand that if i had a few more friends like you and bob i'd be dead.
inez has a master key to all these rooms doesn't she. doesn't she.
i don't think we can do that.
look. i'm ready to get the fuck out of here. it's real torture for me to be here. getting the shit kicked out of me by mexicans.

he was a nice guy.
yeah. as a girl.
wait for kumar.

treadstone.
let's talk about conklin.
what happened. jason bourne happened. you've got the files. then let's cut the crap. it went wrong. conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. bourne was his number one guy went out to work screwed the op and never came back. conklin couldn't fix it couldn't find bourne couldn't adjust. it all went sideways. finally there were no options left.
at the time of his death conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
she say what time i should call.
i did my box work but i wanted to show you before i showed landy. i came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. i mean i'm with you on this conklin was a nut but a traitor. i just can't get there.

then you think it might have worked out.
what's happened to how are you doing that.
oh fine i guess. it's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up so i haven't
yeah good what else do you remember.
how did you get in here. you're under age.

don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
oh. well thanks for the drink.
here's where a little research comes in handy. corporate banks give out vp titles like calendars. it's a small lie but now we're sure he's playing.

oh jake. you disappoint me. and you just let lily here down again. what was it you said about playing the big con.

did uh did you kill him.
so there it is. you got that big itch you need to scratch. it's all about the fucking money. what do you want an apology.
what do you get lily. finder's fee. because it is all about the money right.
then shut up.
stop waving that thing around.
i was supposed to meet him for breakfast. he likes that new ihop they just opened you know he likes to order that thing. the rutti- tutti-fresh and fruity thing they got.

i hope it brings you luck.
gambling's not about money.

but you can't explode in the bomb bay. it's foolish. you'll kill us all. there's no reason for it.
are you willing to entertain a few concepts.
but how do you know you exist.
intuition is no proof. what concrete evidence do you have of your own existence.
that's good. very good. now then how do you know that anything else exists.
my sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
what i'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. and this data is merely a stream of electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
i recall distinctly the detonation order. my memory is good on matters like these.
which one.
any of 'em any good.
the new star. what are you gonna name it.
fred.
veil nebula.
 automatic channels open 
yeah doolittle. what's up.
you know talby you really ought to eat with the rest of us. you spend too much time up here.
the waves at malibu and zuma were fantastic in the springs talby. i can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit
ah lieutenant doolittle. sir.
i'm glad you've come to talk with me doolittle. it's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
doolittle you must tell me one thing.
ah so many malfunctions why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me. oh well did you try the azimuth clutch.
negative effect.
sorry.
we're running out of time sir.
but see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
no.
same old story. not interested.
i'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
i know.
original cindy say hi to my good friend
girlfriend.
me. you're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
look if i made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out
i haven't been able to get you off my mind.
how well do you remember the lab.
your basic hodge-podge.
you're a soldier max. that's what you were put here for. but soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
i would've come sooner buti didn't how're you doin'.
you are involved. by being alive you're involved.
civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes. but logan and max with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
none.
i think you should go now.
what about the other kids. you get anything on them.
caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike. used a car jack to blow out my u lock and bent a bunch of spokes. so now i gotta get my wheels fixed.
unlikely.
and because i actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
besides think of the drama i'm sparing natalie.
not right now.
i actually know how this works.
and she bought that.
quitting time. grab a cold one.
hey sketchy
exactly.
a philandering pig.
that was extreme. did you see that one guy
for a change.
what about this.
huh.
we've got to take this slow
coming dad. i'll call you. soon as we get a phone. bye.
oh great. i just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads i'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown detroit called disco inferno. mind droppin' me there.
well the least we his only buds in the world can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
what's in sandusky.
yeah she gives you shit and you take it.
now how are we gonna do this.
here's a suggestion. let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this volvo situation.
i mean my mom's got insurance. what's the worst thing she could do. ground me for the entire year. i can handle that
four dudes sneaking in. we'd get busted fer sure. bad plan.
dude if it were dancing the way fred astaire did it i'd give it my best shot. i'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. but this tribal ritualistic bullshit it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
the kiss tickets you nimrod. they're just fuckin' gone. please tell me you have'm.
all right. after school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to detroit rock city.
if he offers you a slice you're not the least bit hungry check.
don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off.
i got
but my plan involves all four of us acting together.
you're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
if i'm anything like you i'll deserve him.
well. continue. continue.
but we took the keys.
don't try to run maggot. chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
so according to hawking wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
so in order to travel back in time you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light 
like a spear that comes out of your stomach.
if you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach you could see into the future. and that's a form of time travel right.
i didn't say shit.
i am so sorry.
how much longer is this gonna last.
oh i have those too. what kind of problems does your dad have.
i'm sorry. i was in jail once. i accidentally burned down this house. it was abandoned. i got held back in school again. can't drive until i'm eighteen. i think when i grow up i want to be a painter. or maybe a writer or maybe both. then i'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. you know change things.
you mean soap.
wonder where we'll be then.
so when you sleepwalk can you remember afterward. like do you dream.
it's like this big force that's in your brain. but sometimes it grows bigger and it spread down into your arms and legs and it just sends you someplace.
with like images.
and what.
we're moving through time.
how does it feel to have a wacko for a son.
is the death of one species less tragic than another.
what do i tell the rest of the class when they ask about you.
have you told gretchen about the spears.
people get hurt.
but it was an accident. the house was under construction.
then how is time travel possible.
where is he donald.
i think you are afraid to ask me for advice. i think that you are a very troubled confused young man. i think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
thank you for seeing us we just felt that it was time to discuss
how did you know 
it is a big deal.
do you even know who graham greene is.
oh kitty i don't know. this is so last-minute eddie is in new york
wicked.
we got eggs water balloons and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
hell-no she ain't quittin'.
once a carnie always a carnie.
really loretta.
amber
if you're gettin' at somethin' you better just say it.
if you want seconds then i'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
so anyone talk to janelle.
i know it doesn't matter but on my inner thighs.
i know.
oh naw. hi.
well excuse me annette but i'm braggin' up your kid here. amber's gonna be the next diane sawyer y'know
go on home loretta. come on. go on the party's over.
dakota.
ohio
what.
what a surprise. gladys leeman's finally gonna go to state. and she'll probably ride on becky's ass all the way to nationals too.
iris stop. it's not his fault. the communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
are we on cops. are we on cops. are we on cops.
close up shop. close up shop hank.
i want to have the big bag of little donuts.
no. we not like to hear it. go to your room and shut up.
of course you're all aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where i'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
the king can do to wrong.
my dear president
my president
who to.
in her dressing room. why what could he be doing there.
what's the matter with you.
'at's-a no good. i went to niagara falls once.
that's a-no good. if i apologize we no got a war. look i send you a scrap of paper. you send me a scrap of paper and we have a scrap.
you're lucky i don't slap your face you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. where did you hear that story.
by the way are you sure we need a spy.
you no gotta no gun.
that's funny we've got five thousand horses but no men.
that's-a pretty good. i'll take a dozen of them.
fine - keep on yelling - do everything you can to disturb firefly - now what about your cousin.
if chewing gum is chewed the chewer is pursued and in the hoosegow hidden
oh your excellency isn't there something i can do.
i bring you the greetings of my president and the good will of my people.
bah.
ambassador. i am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
frederick why are you so interested in this particular case.
you stay with me.
hmmm.
oh that's absurd frederick. no no frederick that's all wrong. john is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. and that is completely due to you.
like this.
i like doing business with you. you and i understand each other completely. i know i can trust you. can't i.
i want my man back.
he's still very sick. please come downstairs with me. i'll explain the situation.
three quarters of an hour.
abominable things these machines. one can't reason with them.
what say you fair one. that the tongues of men are full of deceits.
have not saints lips and holy palmers too.
i'm very grateful to you mrs. kendal. this is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. john will be very excited.
you alright.
of course. you want out.
oh no my friend
oh yes.
good morning mr. merrick.
but it's so good i mean it's so very good.
thank you very much.
yes.
hello
john merrick.
merrick
why my dear mrs. mothershead how good of you to join us. mr. merrick will you please introduce yourself.
mr. merrick likes the food here. don't you john.
this is my new home.
ohhh
would you would you like to see my mother.
your mother.
you want a dressing bag john.
my home.
i've heard.
parrots can do as much mr. treves. it's all very nice but i don't see the point. you know they won't let him stay here.
now mothershead you have to understand that this is very good for john. he relishes contact with people outside the hospital
aren't you being just a little harsh mothershead. you yourself hardly treated john with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
a dressing bag.
a dressing bag.
pardon me.
ah. so you admit there is someone.
yes.
have you ever felt like this about anyone else.
no i mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart someone whose goals suddenly seem to be your goals whose dreams seem to be your dreams.
but you loved her all the same
the cloak invisible. it was my mother's parting gift.
no. no. we are in the spell of the horn. hatred will destroy us.
do you believe i love you.
there is something i must ask the gods
well obviously there's no killing.
careful. they're not supposed to hurt you.
shut up.
you don't love me.
i'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
why. why have you got to go round killing and looting.
what's the point of being dead in the land of the living.
slower. nobody can row at that speed.
listen. maybe we won't get to hy- brasil. maybe we won't find the horn resounding but at least we've tried and at least we shall have died like men.
look i bagged it last week.
i came to find my grandfather.
well. come on.
get away snorri.
oh i couldn't do that. the blacksmith's code says
can't make enough swords.
sh. hurry.
you do it.
you went berserk
but it's a responsibility
and don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
you weren't supposed to see that.
i hope you feel better sweetie.
this is the night you met clementine joel. i remember watching you walk down the beach with her and i thought oh shit.
who was the girl you walked off with.
how are you today.
yeah. tom waits says it in 
exactly. tom waits. which song.
purple haze pink eraser.
you think that could possibly be a full time job. how many hair colors could there be.
i'm sure you would.
oh i doubt that's the case.
my embarrassing admission is i really like that you're nice. right now anyway. i can't tell from one moment to the next what i'm going to like. but right now i'm glad you said that's okay to me. that was nice of you.
no that's okay. thanks though.
it's okay.
yeah. i can't remember that album very well. i remember liking it. but 
the song's 9th and hennepin. i spent most of the train ride trying to remember. till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/and you spill out/over the side to anyone who'll listen. remember.
very much.
it's pretty.
me neither. but sometimes i have premonitions so i don't know. maybe that's just coincidence. right. y'know you think something and then it happens or you think a word and then someone says it. y'know.
like i wanted to talk to you. i didn't need any more reason to do it. who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist.
no not at all.
that made me cry. but anyway we went up to boston because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river. it gets frozen this time of year.
i don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore but he says so many great things. we like the same writers. this writer stephen dixon he turned me on to. and he's cute. it's fucked up. joel you should come up to the charles with me sometime.
okay.
i have to get up early in the morning tomorrow so
you can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it.
no.
yes indeed. fuck. they're erasing you clem.
i'm scared. i want my mommy. i don't want to lose you. i don't want to lose
there's this guy.
he stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased.
don't call me antoine. my name is wally.
they found us before. the plan didn't work. i don't know what to do now.
look at you cutey. what are we doing.
i want to enjoy my little time left with you.
i know.
yeah.
me too. there's this poem 
did this conversation come before or after we saw the house.
i knew by your nervousness that naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
i did. i walked out the door. i felt like i was a scared little kid. i thought you knew that about me. i ran back to the bonfire trying to outrun my humiliation. you said so go with such disdain.
i walked out the door. there's no more memory.
i sort of do. but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality. cleaned up enough to be erotic.
hmmm. do you miss me.
i don't know. panties and 
hi.
okay. i wish you could come.
we can help you through this. why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with clementine.
yours.
no. i just need some space maybe.
you didn't miss much. rob and carrie say hello.
so you don't mind.
say hi to rob and carrie. have some fun.
i hope you get your work done.
well it was my fault the break- up. i'm sorry.
oh hey patrick.
yup.
it's not erasing. he's off the screen.
well what should we do.
you better go.
how did i look.
i won't allow it. those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. what do you think of that. that's from my quote book.
okay we're back in.
that was beautiful to watch howard. like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
yes shit. oops sorry. sorry. it's just i told myself i wasn't going to say pope alexander and sound like a dope and then i go ahead and do it. like i psyched myself out.
really. i thought it was appropriate maybe. that's all. i really admire the work that you do. i know it's not proper to be so familiar but i guess since we're outside the workplace i feel a certain liberty to 
it's fine mary. i'm happy to hear it.
do you love me. did you love me. something. i listened to my tape. i can't believe i've been sitting right in front of it for a year. it's like listening to someone else's story. i mean i hear myself talking about having sex with you and i can't even imagine you naked. i can't even say naked to you.
jesus. all right what's the address.
ah your journal. this will be invaluable.
i tried that already.
i think he's in a conference. unfortunately. i'm really sorry.
it's an apartment.
did i tell you i have a new girlfriend.
she was unconscious patrick.
clockworks.
the clockworks is one reason that i am here on siwash ridge. i accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the clock people.
well if the clock people give you any inside information on the end of the world drop us a postcard.
i know but where do you reside when you aren't visiting new york.
er you seem to know who i am and maybe even what i am. thanks for the breakfast.
no i'm afraid that part isn't true. jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field but he was hardly my lover. besides i always travel alone.
did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth. it's not original. it's something i picked up from the chink.
really. the chink huh. i've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. what else have you learned from the chink.
so be it. it looks serious this time though. all these guns are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes.
if we ivy leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'chink.' next thing i know you'll be calling me 'chief.'
what are you doing.
but i don't want you to leave. please stay. we can go to dinner. i owe you a dinner. and tonight we can really make love.
why. why do you have to go.
so now you're bummin' around.
tired
a born freak can only go uphill.
your ranch.
the food and drug administration said wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters burns and rashes. although the fda judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
okay listen up. as you all know by now we have an addition to our crew. dr. weir this is: starck navigation; smith pilot justin ship's engineer 
coop where are you
you been out there a long time. trying to break my record.
it's holding she's holding.
no he didn't.
how. the bridge is gone.
there must be a way. what about engineering.
to conserve our oxygen we should severely restrict our activity. anyone who can should get some sleep.
dj. the clark's gone. smith and cooper are dead.
i've got a pulse he's alive
it's not that simple. lyle play the recording for dr. weir.
justin finish your sweep.
dr. weir you have no experience with salvage procedures.
i can understand your desire to redeem your reputation dr. weir but it doesn't factor into this.
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months. they're been gone seven years.
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers. good for four months.
peters is right no one's here.
captain miller i just want to say
doctor weir my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. we were pulled off a well deserved leave to be sent out to the middle of nowhere and no one's even told us why.
to rescue the crew and salvage the ship. the crew is dead dr. weir. this ship killed them. and now it's killing us.
what about my ship.
then who the fuck are you.
there is no devil. there is no god. there is only nothing.
i don't like it either but you know the rules: we get the call we go. is the course locked in.
heading three-three-four
but
something's wrong with the bio-scan.
i don't know but whatever it is it's not the crew.
who.
to what. what are you saying. this ship is alive.
he's awake he's in the airlock he's not wearing a suit.
he's engaged the override.
we have to do something oh god
what the hell is that.
the scope is lit it's right in front of us
what is it.
those yours too.
oh he did.
soon as i'm back i'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
they crashed it into a wall. a flight simulator.
i don't know. i just keep going over and over the numbers.
glad nothing could take you away from your work.
'course not. strictly business.
no more cracks about how i look.
my shift ends at four but i couldn't 
victor's right. johnny get to the command center. close the shields.
this is wrong in so many ways.
apparently i can disappear.
front page.

sue. your clothes. lose them.
anger. rage. frustration.
reed. i was ready for the next step you weren't ergo i walked.

she's in my biology class.
no. it's too soon.
hey mark. is that you.
no. i don't think so. not right now.
and you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
i hear you brought a film clip with you. do you want to set it up for us.
hey slow down. this is my brother's car.
suzanne somers' tits.
will you just relax mon. he's not gonna kill us. my father is a television repairman. he's got all kinds of tools. i can fix-this car.
yeah but i fucked up. you can take it. really.
stacy what are you waiting for. you're fifteen. i did it when i was thirteen. it's no huge thing. it's just sex. if you don't one of the other girls will.
doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. that's why i'm marrying him.
don't you think it meant anything to him. even if i am fifteen.
you really ought to look at this linda. there's a drawing on every page and all these quizzes. it's like school.
okay penis that's one balls

i'm not cured. i was never sick. they had no business putting me in there. my only responsibility is to myself now.
of course she hasn't anything definite in mind.
you know little sister i never resented you for refusing to see me in the the hospital. i knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
little sister i don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. i want you to rest for a while anyway.
no. all you've done is try to break my spirit try to turn me into you. but i'm not you mother and i never will be and thank god for it. that goes for you too. and frankly i don't know how with the two of you i turned out as sane as i am  wait right there gentlemen i'll be with you in a minute and believe me i don't want to stay here one second longer than i have to. but i've got to tell you lillian that one day before you die you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. in shame.

o'neil.
how'd you make it last time wick. how'd you get through this part.
i'm sorry o'neil. but as class officer it's my obligation to report all violations.
i think you're the liar.
we didn't know we were compromised. firing would only've given away our position.

commander do you have a camera. i'd die to see this in person all they showed on tv was a machine here and a wall here i don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
no i am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer but a matter rearranger converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
raise the glass and push the blue button.
i just can't believe it. any of it. look at this room they designed it based on the tuaran pleasure ship from historical document thirty seven. oh and wait wait listen to this. computer.

mind if we skip that. i have to get back pretty quick for this thing in van nuys.
but what if sarris survives.
former commander.
well sort of
i'm not a commander there is no national space exploration administration. there is no snip.
the ship is a model as big as this. a very clever deception indeed. he oan't oontaln his lauchter. a belle-tommy set a course for home lommander.
no no no.
jason. what about me. what do i do.
enerao i've host them. the maanetlsm o: the field is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. there they are
what. wh
over three hundred miles.
and a french alliance.
why in hell would john do that. why in hell would any of them do that. after all you've done it's unbelievable.
go on i want to hear everything.
there's this whispering campaign against me ever since gates won at saratoga.
as soon as the men have good shelters i'll move. perhaps martha will join me this winter.
me. you apologizing to me.
yes general.
by red what rank would you say this black officer soldier is colonel.
hamilton you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
they're among the best divisions the british have. no conscripts no impressed recruits just professional killers.
you won't be needing his largess rhode island is already committed to your appointment.
colonel charles lee hounds and all. quite the character. he's got a tremendous reputation.
they are friends of congress.
did god ever make such a pitiful army.
no officer is going to get these men to fight. they had the life crushed out of them on long island. at the most perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost then retire to protect congress.
how many generals do we have like arnold. he's got guts he's vain and he fights.
and hamilton. greene.
arnold is indispensable do you understand. i need arnold to help me win this war.
'charming little victories.' please don't expect much more of us monsieur.
i only meant
did you know that jefferson has proposed a law in virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church.
what else. from virginia.
is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men. it's damned condescending.
we can't take them. are you all right.
at one time i could have chosen not to be.
what the hell are we doing.
sir i have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform
where do those men come from george.
i see
that. i hear a mob: unemployed drunkards vagabonds the world's dregs.

doesn't matter what it's called harry's got martin weir and it's gonna be big.
you guess. you mean you don't know.
listen tonight later on i got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. i want you to go have a look around chili palmer's hotel room.
into air bags. there's no cushion under what you're doing. i'm out of it cat. i'm done.
i heard in the federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your daddy on father's day.
after this one i'm out cat you understand. this is the last time we talk to each other.
you must bring something heavy to the deal.
title's the first thing's got to go. and the guy's name. i mean even this writer's name murray saffrin is better than lovejoy.
young. she's fuckin' nine-years-old same age as lovejoy's kid. bernie. one she calls bernard. have you read the script.
there's nothin' to know. you have an idea you write down what you wanna say. then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong if you aren't positive yourself. maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words although i've seen scripts where i know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. so i don't think it's too important. anyway you come to the last page you write in 'fade out' and that's the end you're done.
i'll find it.
man i can't wait for you to be dead.
bo. i'm great. listen i'm expecting some people –-
listen harry how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand. you pay me back at your convenience no interest.
ray barboni.
are you the guy they called ray bones.
who is this. i'm the one telling you the way it is okay asshole. that's who i am. now you want your three hundred grand or don't you.
yeah i'm here. i just don't like the anonymous crap. it means your either chickenshit or not for real.
where's leo devoe. where's chili palmer. where's my fuckin' money.
tough shit bro. this ain't miami. you want something talk to me.
your wife a lakers fan.
leo spanked a waitress.
a marker's like a check harry.
that's half a movie with holes in it. maybe forty minutes of screen time. you don't even have a girl a female lead and on top of that there's no one to sympathize with you don't have a good guy.
ever shot anybody.
you got that on the brain harry. if you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to vegas to begin with.
for a movie.
so you're thinking what if i was to put you next to my dry cleaner. ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
yeah he wants us to talk to buddy set up a meeting.
harry if i gave you leo's money you'd have ray bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
you got a miss. leo devoe. guy's six weeks over.
guy owes me fifteen large and takes off i go after him. the fuck you think i do.
martin look at me.
i believe it.
yeah but you haven't found him yet. the guy took off for las vegas.
at that point basically that has to be it.
compass.
from when. you left vegas with four- fifty.
i wouldn't let her if she tried. why i'm here leo basically is to save your ass.
how. by taking my money.
no no you left the patio door open. you gotta stop doin' that all the nice things you got around here.
rough day on the set.
how come you stopped making movies with harry.
you read harry's new one. he says it's the best thing he's ever read.
right. see how your story ends.
i don't know.
yeah the guy owes momo a few g's.
momo could buy it i could run it for him. show some cagney films.
i hate to say i told you but i did. i told you don't start nothing with him that time.
no you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
that's great harry. so what's the 
that miami flight that went down it was on the news every day for about a week. harry must've been busy.
i have to run. but what i hope to see they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. it becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it but in the end they can't. can they.
a passenger liner. over.
hear that dodge. epps don't think it's a problem.
you think the extra strain caused it.
take it easy dodge. it's only a piece of metal.
one more.
so we kill him.
did you.
you aren't jealous are you dodge.
what the hell would a freighter be doing up here. it's way out of the lanes. there's not a port for 800 miles.

we'll stand the watch on deck tonight. you're up first.
you're late.
that's what i call a payday.

maybe they didn't want it back. maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
epps.
he needs a doctor.
how's he doing.
but where's the damage.
what do you think happened on this boat.
are we smart enough to avoid that.
when you found me yesterday at the pool. i'd seen something. someone.
what like some kind of ghost.
maybe hallucination is the wrong word. it was more than that. as though they were showing me.
epps over.
what do we do with him.
could be a stroke. who knows. the general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. like wild dogs.
what happened.

what the hell is wrong with you.
but i feel weird it's so sleazy.
who doug. he spends more time here than i do
come on josh don't you want to see where he lives.
no.
but this guy is like a one-of-kind rare butterfly and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat
do you want something to drink.
are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms.
yeah right well why not. what's so wrong with me.
hi enid.
this is so bad it's almost good.
unless they're in your summer school class.
shut up.
how perfect.
god just think we'll never see dennis again.
why.
what do you do if you're a satanist anyway.
maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and 
you can have that one.
are you sure.
you just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.

oh uh thanks a lot enid i really appreciate it
i know. it's not like it makes all your problems go away.
never mind it's way too complicated did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time.

i'm going to try and locate redbeard- i assume you've heard of him.
i know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey- -but what are you going to do about it.
i'm david hawthorne this is my hospital. and my advice to you is don't get sick in front of it. that was meant to be charming sorry. i seem to have lost the knack.
-then he feasted on him starting with his feet-
that's a terrible idea-
-is it i'm sorry but then of course you're the doctor you should know.
we're not much good at goodbyes helena.
go now. such a gentleman.
-well of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
he just gave me his monster speech.
samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
i don't suppose i could watch.
might be exciting for you.
shhh.
-you'll have to deal with it nigel.
john. i know this isn't the time to ask but-
all right- thee second embankment will go there.
you do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just- -there.
john it will not be easy.
what did i do.
nonsense- samuel would have done something.
we need to talk.
has it ever done that before.
but of course yours worked.

we should construct thorn fences around every tent area. fires burning at night.
thank you. why does he need you by him.
why so many.
some russian princes want to hunt the himalayas. you.
you know you are really doing very good work here. i think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
i don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
time is running out dana. soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine and vigo's. well mainly vigo's. but we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
i won't.
i'm not a doorman miss barrett. i'm a building superintendent.
he didn't ditch me. we had some problems he got a good offer from an orchestra in england and he took it.
you never asked me and every time i brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
his name is oscar.
i may be wrong but i think you've got a little crush on this guy.
who could blame him. were you wearing this nightgown.
we'll take care of that. ray pete. listen get over to dana's right away her bathtub pulled a fast one tried to eat the kid.
how about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
thank you. poor baby. i think i should put him down now.
does she know anything about babies.
i put them in your hamper. i thought they were dirty.
why do you say things like that. you're so much better than you know.
that's a terrible thing to say.
i was trying to get that smelly green thing. the guys asked me to help out. i'm like the fifth ghostbuster.
why would you want to be a ghostbuster if you're already an accountant.
motherhood is a very natural instinct for me. i'd like to have a baby myself. wouldn't you.
pleasure to meet you. i've seen you on television.
like what.
this year. that's cutting it a little close isn't it. i mean just from a sales point of view the book just came out right. so you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year. and it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. you would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
i think they're more interested in my epididymis.
what now brainiac.
that's a thousand million electron volts.
it's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
this is about as deep as you can go under manhattan without digging your own hole.
that's it. it's on the bottom.
we've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
there's definitely something going on in that studio. the pke levels were max-plus and the giga-meter was showing all red.
oh hello perhaps you could help me. i'm looking for an aerosol love potion i could spray on a certain penthouse pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
aaah. nobody. i can't tell you.
what happened.
i think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip boys. let me know what you find out.
yeah sorry i missed it. i guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here. it's really kind of a coat and tie place.
give it up ray. you're living in the past. ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore. in a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
yeah what did we do ray. the last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
and he didn't die of old age either. he was poisoned stabbed shot hung stretched disemboweled drawn and quartered.
she's moving.
ray ray how do you feel man.
to the bathroom where do you think.
oh dana it's you 
oh that's nice louis. i'll stop by if i'm around.
are you the gatekeeper.
yes well i'm not sure. what i have to say may sound a little unusual.
is that your professional opinion.
damn.
there's nothing there now and i don't get any significant readings.
this is terrible. either there's a monster in my kitchen or i'm completely crazy.
you think i enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients. i'm making an exception because i respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
we must prepare for the coming of gozer.
fine. this university will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.

i collect spores molds and fungus.
i want you to have this.
great. how's it going.
and how many ghosts have you caught mr. venkman.
and where do you put these ghosts once you catch them.
you turned off the power. look there was another man here you have to find him and bring him back. a short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
yes. i don't like this.
well just 75 more to go. what's this one.
yeah but i didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks. what are you trying to prove.
hey mister. can i see those guns.
you're a regular sherlock holmes. now what do you want.
i'm always serious.
generally you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance. what do you think egon.
what do you mean bad.
where's the keymaster.
sit tight. i'm on my way.
who was the architect.
do you believe in god.
ray do you remember something in the bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves.
yeah judgement day.
stantz. you okay in there.
i should at least have you don't you think.
where have you been.
if i ever loved narcissus it wasn't like you want.
yes. go on.
lykas pick a man. someone who will look good. jerses i want it built up in the daily action
that's difficult to say general.
so am i.
caesar commodus discovering his lineage converges with the demigod hercules has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens. the emperor's going to fight in the arena. i'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
i've read of it.
the trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
you're hearing about somebody else.
is this rome. are we just going to be executed.
no future-telling please i've been terrified enough for one day.
why do you keep playing at being so humble. it's a little embarrassing.
i don't believe that. he's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron. you know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of germany.
twenty years i've led men to die. for me it was the glory of rome. but that was something. if it wasn't that then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore but that was something. these men here are butchered for laughs. their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line.
to think i brought my daughters up on all things roman. read to sleep on catullus lucretius virgil every night. my beautiful daughters.
if you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. but
he killed his father and then my family
the senators admire you.
what deal.
i'm a soldier we're at war. i can't stay home tending the damned olive groves.
do you want to see themis and manto butchered. if i die fighting commodus he won't care about you. if i live i'll come and get you.
i killed too many barbarians.
the point is you get to fight the easy country circuit the small arenas relax live the good life.
a great deal. they designed and build tiger's chariot
no. tell them i'll do it. but i want more posters all over rome.
do you want some dinner.
benjamin do you dislike me for some reason.
no why should i.
will you take me home now.
i think i'd better go home now please.
but could i just tell you this one thing.
we won't. let's go inside.
benjamin what's happening.
what.
get out.
don't cry.
well i want you to leave.
benjamin.
is that so. you might marry me.
when.
i don't know. i don't know what's happening.
we just can.
elaine are you serious about this.
benjamin i haven't even said i'll marry you yet.
well i have to see carl first.
well what did he say. i'm curious.
yes i am.
what are you then.
who screamed.
i'm putting it here by the door.
oh yes. the singleman party.
a single room or a double room.

well why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed.
you've known me nearly all of your life. you must have formed some opinion.

please forgive me. because i like you. i don't think of you that way. but i'm mixed up.
all right. now finish your drink.
we'll forget it right now. finish your drink.
benjamin.
if you still think i'm trying to seduce you 
i'm not scared mrs. robinson.
then why do you keep running away.
i don't see why. i'm twice as old as you are. how could anyone think 
i'll be up in five minutes.
well goodbye then 
the number.
benjamin.
i'll get undressed now. is that all right.

will you bring me a hanger.
what.
oh yes. wood.
what.
either one will be fine.
it is isn't it. it is your first time.
you can admit that can't you.
if you want.
all we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
you're not interested in art.
no.
can i take off my clothes now.
what.
i walk out.
benjamin this isn't a very interesting topic.
now let's keep going here.
on new year's eve. sometimes on his birthday.
but you don't hate him.
what.
how do you think.
don't talk about elaine.
no.
we're not dropping it. now that's the reason isn't it. i'm a dirty degenerate aren't i. i'm not fit to 
i'm good enough for you but i'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. that's it isn't it. isn't it.
no sir. i am not proud that i spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic.
because mrs. robinson this is the sickest most perverted thing that ever happened to me. and you do what you want but i'm getting the hell out.
now don't start this.
don't start acting hurt.
but it's not.
you don't have to say that.
this is absurd.
thank you. benjamin 
drive down the block.
braddock braddock.
when i go off.
you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
what else.
well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day benjamin.
no.
i guess she's not good enough for you is that it.
oh no.
thank you.
yes sir.
oh say elaine gets down from berkeley on saturday.
well i don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other ben. i do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. i do think you should know that my wife and i are getting a divorce soon.
huh.
i'd like to discuss this.
i oughtn't to presume but i  i'm so grateful to you it's been so marvelous. the first time in my life i have gambled i've danced. oh you can laugh gentlemen but it's the first time in my life i've ever tasted life.
life gentlemen is wonderful but very dangerous. you must have courage for it then it's wonderful. you gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy but i believe me a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
it's a short life and a gay one
you are late the dancer's gone to the theatre.
no no no no
he must be very nice.
whoever is keeping you waiting.
money ever heard of it.
did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on. one that she'd bought herself.
chasing around.
why.
flaemmchen what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
nothing only to be here.
why do you look at me like that.
i did not know you were so beautiful and 
and and 
i never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
a man who could love that is all who has forgotten everything else for you.
you could love me. it is so long since i have heard that word. nobody has loved me for a long time. it is so icy-cold to be famous. one is so cruelly alone. how is it that you let me look at you. your hands. your eyes. why could you love me.
what.
oh i was ambitious then ambition was in my blood no rest no stopping. we were drilled like little soldiers we danced in the school of the imperial ballet in st. petersburg. i was little and slim but hard as diamond a duty machine no rest no stopping. and then i became famous and whoever is famous is alone but why should i be telling you this. last night i did not know you at all who are you really. i do not even know your name.
no.
and then in the war to kill and hide. that's all.
i'll go good-bye.
when are you leaving berlin.
why later.
on the train.
i'm baron von gaigern.
what's the matter mr. kringelein.
baron we must have gone a hundred miles an hour at least

good heavens. what for.
no doctor.
there is no pocketbook here on the floor probably.

you may laugh. caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you but to me they mean a great deal. you see i'm ill and all of a sudden i got a fear of missing life. i don't want to miss life do you understand.

debra you're fuckin' insane.
i didn't he got in a fight and i 
runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in northern europe thousands of years ago. they were symbols carved out of stone or pieces of wood. of all the runes thorn had the most negative influence. cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
danny. danny.
unlike you sam i learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. remember what freud said: 'sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.' or in this case a drink is just a drink.
yes tommy. what are you doing here.
miss me baby.
you know what gets me.
how everybody says fuck and shit all the time. i used to be scared shitless i'd say fuck or shit in public by accident. now everybody says fuck and shit fuck and shit all the time. something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
you were rich before. this is the first time i was ever rich.
when i drive it i feel like i'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum. i don't hear anything i don't feel anything. i figure somebody else is driving. it's a bitch.
you know what gets me.
what's funny about that.
excuse me.
sorry. at least you've got a place to come back to. i don't have a place to come back to anymore.
tit for tatas simple as that.
you.
i forget mine for years on end.
i can't get over how you guys are my friends. harold ryan and looseleaf harper are my friends.
it's engineered to last about fifteen years.
anybody home.
hello.
he was a stretcher-bearer in the korean war. were you in a war with father.
oh hell.
tell me that.
hid by dayfought by night. at sunset one day your father and i peering through field glasses saw a black mercedes draw up to a village inn. it was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car. out of the mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of historythe beast of yugoslavia.
uck.
i wanted to go out for football but mom was afraid i'd get hurt.
does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that.
is looseleaf harper alive.
she's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
no.
welcome to manhood you little sparrowfart. load that gun.
get mad. tell me you don't like the way i treat your mother. tell me you wish i'd never come home.
destiny often seems that way. you're going to marry me.
how do you do mrs. ryan. i'd heard you were beautiful and so you are. am i intruding here.
what sort of time period do you have in mind. half an hour. an hour.
seemed the most honest way to begin life together againnatural unrehearsed.
you know what i want. i want you both to be friends. i know you both respect you both. you should be friends.
nothing would please me more.
he doesn't deserve this. you don't know him. it isn't fair.
you're thinking with your brain instead of your body. that's why you're so tense. forget norbert. relax. it's body time.
bring me a side order of mrs. wheeler.
cook by god. cook. you're the nigger now.
you leave me soso without without dignity.
they don't have to feel like slaves.
that's what you're supposed to say.
this is not a coy deception. i do not want to be scrogged. i want love. i want tenderness.
well i can. some injuries spiritual or physical can be excruciating to me. i'm not a silly carhop any more. maybe you're right about fish. when i was a carhop i didn't feel much more than a fish would. but i've been sensitized. i have ideas nowand solid information. i know a lot more nowand a lot of it has to do with you.
such as.
it's complicated and i don't want to go into it now because it's bound to sound insultingeven though nobody means for anybody to be insulted. it's just the truth.
you took him to the funeral i hear.
testimonials of that sort areare beyond my range. i don't do them well. that's a failing i know.
rifle.
he's afraid of you harold. he knew you'd want to fight him. he doesn't know anything about fighting. he hates pain.
what kind of a country has this become. the men wear beads and refuse to fightand the woman adore them. america's days of greatness are over. it has drunk the blue soup.
he's a child.
that's really what you want. you become furious when people won't make you dead.
then you'd better fix your bayonet because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
can iuhhelp you gentlemen.
you'reyou're old friends of harold ryan.
oh dear.
areare you crying penelope.
i feel the same way. what next.
colonel harper and i once shared a treetop with a family of bats. there was a flash flood. there were piranha fish in the water. that's how colonel harper lost his little toe.
pacqualinincheewa root. means cougar fang. cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
yes.
you're a filthy rotten bastard.
i haven't told you harold how comical i think you are.
i'm an honorable clown.
the new hero is you.
but the new hero will be a man of science and of peacelike me. he'll disarm you of course. no more guns no more guns.
you're making a mistake. obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded. you've wounded me.
oh godyou're really going to kill me. harold it won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee. heaven is very much like paradise they say. you'll like it there.
new lives begin.
it was a bitch.
she did.
yes.
that is sad.
you bet i'll worry about it. i said something wrong.
i feel like i want to yell my head offjust yell anything. bulllllllllllllll-dickey.
stay home tonight.
a lot of people don't.
what.
yeah.
then get him.
we don't have a maid any more.
everything stays as it is.
how's the fungus around your thumbnail.
it's fine.
i keep having this nightmarethat he catches us.
he'd assume we had.
something happens to my confidence.
i'm touched.
yeah.
we've got to find him. i want you to show me exactly where you saw him last. and you stay here norbert in case he comes home. that's all he saidthe thing about the key.
i didn't make my move fast enough. that's it isn't it. i was too respectful.
it's true.
i am dr. norbert woodlya physician a healer. i find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society. gentleness must replace violence everywhere or we are doomed.
after this explosion i think he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
he told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. he made eagle scout when he was twenty-nine years old. oh norbertpromise me that paul has not gone into the park.
i'd be dead by now if that were the case.
and maybe paul. what about the murderers. they're in there.
they didn't murder me.
if he is in the park luck is all that can save him now and there's plenty of that.
i'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
i'm sick of this argument. i just have one more thing to say: if you elect a president you support him no matter what he does. that's the only way you can have a country.
if he'd just come out for the little league the way i asked him he'd find out we touch all the timeshove each other slug each other and just horse around. i'm going to go get him
no just not the type.
you may do that in the privacy of your room.
you're still dressed.
look that twenty dollars you just paid i don't get any of that. that goes to the guys that own this place. i get two bucks an hour minus ten percent for a bail fund. i make all my money on tips.
what do you mean.
no that would be much too overpowering.
yeah.
where's he.
you're not a film producer are you.
make it nine hundred. that was my best week.
tonight. when you get out we'll go. why didn't you tell the other detective.
jesus.
you won't keep growing at this rate.
you used to work at copper penny.
tod was. he was with ratan.
it's not quite the same thing.
i must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. at least it feels that way.
she left you right.
listen niki. my daughter's been missing five months. i've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. i just saw a girl killed. i will not let tod slip out of my hands. you have to tell me where he is.
but then you'll forget about me.
have you ever seen any ah pornographic movies jake.
they're legal now.
but the police
listen pilgrim you're way out on a limb here. you don't know what you're into.
how did you find me.
where does he hang out.
well
why don't you just go outdoors mister. cool off.
he didn't look good at all. something strange is going on. he's got himself into some trouble. he wouldn't say what.
you don't have to get uppity with me bill. i remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. and what was that other thing you tried. a dairy queen. went busted too.
eh poli sci.
oh i don't have one.
about forty-five minutes wouldn't you say harold. we were hoping to start sooner but you see it's rather hard to find a truck.
oh well. must have been your brother.
but there is a family resemblance.
this way edith. harold is out by the garage. he has a new car and he has been tuning it up. he's very mechanical.
i'm a file clerk - harrison feed and grain.
i don't know.
eh could i have my pen back now please.
do you sing and dance.
now i'll pump it up  and you just turn the handles. okay. what do you smell.
oh. eh i like it.
here we are harold. oat straw tea and ginger pie.
you look as if you could.
me. ha. did i tell you i'll be eighty on saturday.
well it's all very thrilling of course but i ask you harold is it enough.
but what.
well i really don't drink
oh yes. every day. but i don't need a defense anymore. i embrace. still fighting for the big issues but now in my small individual way. shall we have a song.
i think he's following us.
yes so do i. but i think he is a little old-fashioned. like a puff harold.
what was that.
shall i drop by tomorrow. oh i have a luncheon date. with this girl.
maude i must speak to you.
but they'll put me in jail.
oh you've thought of everything. and champagne.
 which i hope will make you very happy.
farewell.
i feel giddy.
never. never. i'll never forget you. i wanted to marry you. don't you understand. i love you. i love you.
at a funeral.
tell me harold how many of these eh suicides have you performed.
i don't know.
your studies.
and so i ask you - why the hell did we give up on the germans. those damn politicians in washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. hell look at history. the two best wars this country has fought were against the jerries. now i say get the krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
yes.
she certainly has.
it's coming.
i knew you'd come back.
kirsty i'm sorry don't understand. i
help. no no-one can help. i just want someone to listen or i will go crazy.
i'm scared.
story of my life.

i worry about you.
c'mon champ. you look a little woozy there.
we should go back you you could tear that door apart

his blood on the floor it brought me back.
poor larry. obedient as ever.
i want an explanation first. i want to know what happened to you.
who did.
the cenobites. the creatures the box set free. sometimes i think they're still here. just behind the walls. them and their hooks and their beasts. just waiting to break out again. except that i've got the box.
you're still afraid.
you would be. they tore me apart.
they took my body but my spirit they left that here. in the boards in the walls. watching the world but not able to touch it.
maybe we should just leave 
just a thought 
how are you doing through there.
just feeling a bit sick.
can i get you anything.
who was it.
what.
drinking alone.
not much.
just soda.
i suppose that's right.

what happened to me.
you'd like my room.
well come over will you. see the place.

you like.
kirsty.

turn it off barry.
but it's my new tape. my monday morning tape. i made it last night just for today.
i wanna date a musician
what did you tell her about the shop for.
we can take your car.
oh no rob that's not obvious enough. not at all. dick did you hear that.
no but would you think from that one sentence. that i was going to see it.
but in your opinion would i definitely go.
suck my ass.
what the fuck is that.
barrytown. barrytown. is there no end to your arrogance.
they were fucking called that before i was in it okay. it wasn't my idea.
great. that's fucking great. they only asked you to sing because of your name. you can stick it above the browser racks over there.
no way.
what is she doing. okay 20%.
you couldn't be. look barry. there's going to be people from laura's work there people who own dogs and babies and tina turner albums. how are you going to cope with them.
what do you think. dick likes it.
oh really. well what about the first jesus and mary chain.
nothing. i just prefer the other one.
isn't her album called number four with a smile.
hey barry.
where's rob.
uh. that's me.
fine. that's great.
oh well the kinky wizards are you know what. why don't i just make you a tape.
rob hi so sorry i missed your call. in la on business. you know how it gets.
yeah sure
good. great. yeah wow. rob gordon. seems like a 100 million years ago now.
fuck. i knew it. you're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
it's all kind of lost in the in the dense mists of time now it wasn't that i really liked marco more. in fact i thought you were more shall we say attractive than him. it was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't and that made a difference somehow. you used to act as if i was weird for wanting to spend time with you and that got kind of beat if you know what i mean. your self-image started to rub off on me and i ended up thinking that i was strange. and i knew that you were kind and thoughtful you made me laugh and i dug the way you got consumed by things you loved and marco seemed a bit more i don't know glamorous. more sure of himself. less hard work because i felt like i was dragging you around sort of. a little sunnier. sparkier. i don't know. you know what people are like at that age. they make very superficial judgements. do you think that's superficial. he was a clown if it's any consolation.
'morning dick.
i'm upset but i'm fine.
shit.
yes. well i'm coming over to your house to get some things.
is that right. i'd like a word with him.
what's the obvious stuff.
what.
yeah. great.
fine i'm sure it's in the file at home. i'll call you when i find it and then we'll talk.
i don't have your number.
hello.
are you still in love with me.
you still together. going all right.
i'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here can you. i mean how much are you making now. sixty. seventy. and you were living in this shitty place.
you know i'm a good person.
okay okay. i get the picture.
you're being deliberately obtuse.
i can't talk right now.
don't worry about it. just get into bed. worry about that when you're better.
who the fuck's pig.
i'm sorry.
look are you coming or not.
what do you mean.
i don't know. sometime. later. listen rob would you have sex with me.
no no. it's not are you still on the pill.
mission accomplished.
want to know what exactly.
because i'm not allowed to. i still do after work. so what. should we just break up. is that what you're saying. because if you are i'm going to run out of patience.
wanna go to dinner.
at paul and miranda's. paul from work.
what do you ever do that can't be cancelled.
that's not the point. i mean what if the single isn't done in time.
it's no joke. i'm responsible for what happens you know. embarrassment aside there's a lot of money and effort in this at least by my standards. i have to put down a deposit for the room. i have to pay the pressing plant for the records sleeve them sticker them 
actually i'm fine. i'm great. last night i got to thinking you know what. maybe it is time to move on. maybe we're just not right for each other. or maybe we are. but time will tell and at this point i'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be. you know.
what difference does it make.
yeah.
hello. anybody there.
meet a nice girl and have children. i promise the next time we talk i'll have it all sorted out.
it's the best collection i've ever seen.
suit yourself. there are plenty of others who will.
uh yes i like do it's simple. you make the tracks recording studio deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut the master is then dubbed to submasters which are the mothers as their called for each press in the plant. you press the cd's or records put in your cover art and that's it.
wait a minute. island records charged u2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
dr. kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral. the father looked just like richard. even had a mark on his cheek.
mr. congeniality. let him find his own clues. there's a journal article in this somewhere.
scottish claymore. take a french epee add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business and you've got a claymore.
you're very macabre.
then you didn't know richard later on.
no.
good reflexes.
i don't know what you're talking about.
he called you macleod.
he's dead. whatever i may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
what about me.
you've been listening to rumors.
i go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad mr. taupin.
it's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
why are you here.
yes.
he knows about you.
you killed those other two.
what's wrong.
it will be horrible. the future. i may die tomorrow or 10000 tomorrows. i can promise you nothing. nothing but a moment. maybe two. but a moment of love is that not worth a lifetime.
aren't you getting a little old for this. you flunked out of law school.
you and i should talk first.
it's bullshit. everything. my job the people i get involved with i'm up to here with it.
hang on a sec you did your little favor for the boys downtown i'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
you see that desk. _your_ desk. you see the crap piled up on it.
i haven't much to offer mr. romirez from spain but you're welcome to what's here.
in my travels i heard the story of the macleod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this earth.
what.
you will live. survive.
go to hell.
impotent cow.
i feel hardly nothing.
but why be so concerned about me.
go ahead senor. i have my friend to keep me company.
so why the crazy talk. it's a miracle it is. saint andrew has smiled on me. on us.
something pretty.
perhaps not. you seem to have misplaced a private. no doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
i am a major private. you would do well remembering that when addressing me.
it can be different. it must be.
your grandfather wore that in his service to the king and i to fight for the duke.
yeah.
spare a chair.
i love zoos. ever since i was a kid.
no seriously. we used to shoot pool together in rangoon.
long time.
yes laddie i have her.
two days ago a bulgarian national was murdered the same way. he'd also been in the country less than a week. what is your citizenship.
that's none of your business.
do you know what this is.
a claymore to be exact. you wouldn't know anything about it would you.
you're a kind man to be sure.
i thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
i got my rhyming dictionary in 
oh it isn't like that.
about twenty-five hundred dollars.
for a minute i thought maybe walter burns was at the back of it. but then i realized he couldn't have been.
you're bruce baldwin.
feels awful good. yes sir we're taking the four o'clock train to albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
well i'll try to give her one.
well i'm independent too.

no. well  johnson you're under arrest. you too burns.
you know what. how long since we've seen each other.
done what.
well i meant to let you go but you know you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
that's the first time you've been right today. that's what i 
great grief. what's that other paper going to give you.
i tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. i'm getting married walter and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as i can get. i'm through.
get married all you want to hildy but you can't quit the newspaper business.
you can't sell me that walter.
where'd you meet this man.
not what you'd call rich. makes about five thousand a year.
the insurance business.
tomorrow. tomorrow as quick as that.
what for.
well i'll tell you one thing old man she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
what now.
now you're talking.
i meant on my grandmother's grave. don't be so technical hildy. what's the story.
she jumped out of the window.
where do you think you're going.
get bruce out of jail. how can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on. hildy this is war. you can't desert now.
i get it.
how much do you want on it.
all the words you've got.
well keep going. we want an extra out on the streets before it's too late.
bruce. oh er he went out to get the tickets.
is he coming back here.
double-crossing swine.
bruce ought to be back by now. walter you're not trying anything again are you.
look at me hildy 
hello eddie. hildy johnson. was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup.
is this the community hospital.
will you come here.
oh i see. i beg your pardon.
just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
don't tell me you were worried.
well if it's my last story i'd like it to be a good one. but i guess i can't walter.
hildy if that's what you want all right. we'll even go to how about niagara falls.
walter.
walter you can't do that.
yes 'hildy darling'. i'm just a fool. that's what i am. i know what it's going to be like.
who do you want.
sure boss.
i mean real money not counterfeit.
he's on my phone. he just called me.
i think it is.
i can't hildy. it means my job. it means 
you said it.
we'll have to satisfy them. what would you say to giving them a joint interview. i could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
well it wasn't exactly that way 
kind of exclusive ain't you. we got calls to make you know.
better let us in on it mollie.
trouble is when the red menace shows up the sheriff will still be crying 'wolf.'
oh i'm sorry gus. my foot must have slipped.

what is it.
i don't know fred. there's that reprieve if they ever find out.
now take that guilty look off your face pete and stop trembling like a horse.
that's a lie.
take those handcuffs off our friends pete. that wasn't at all necessary.
any news.
they're very simple. i believe in the golden rule. i'm not the first man to die for preaching it. but if they would only listen to it we could have a fine decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
don't forget about production for use.
don't talk too loud.
wakin' me up in the middle of the night talkin' to me about things they don't understand. callin' me a bolshevik. i'm an anarchist. it's got nothin' to do with bombs. it's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. you see that don't you.

they will escort you to your rooms now. you will be provided with fresh clothes. tonight you will be dining with his highness.
dr. jones we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. i seem to remember that in honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
the newspapers exaggerated the incident.
and didn't the sultan of madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country.

well i'm working with someone now who was the former head of research at brown & williamson a former corporate officer there.
well it isn't cigarettes are bad for you
i'm going to tell you why. because when i tell someone i'm going to do something i deliver.
oh how fortunate i am to have lowell bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. to show me the way.
that canada story. still interest you.
yeah thank you.
far as you go where.
doesn't cbs have confidentiality agreements mr. bergman.
did work.
to straighten something out with you. right here. right now.
how did brown & williamson know i spoke to you.
you came all the way down here to tell me that.
talk to me outside the zone of your agreement.
like where'd you work before brown & williamson.
johnson & johnson. union carbide in japan. i was general manager and director of new products. i speak japanese. i was a director of corporate development at pfizer. all health-related. what else. outside the zone.
the new place. new.
how'd you know that lowell.
hello. you there
you charge by the hour.
i believe that. yes i believe that.
you attract a crowd.
i told the truth.
yes. did you lie about being on the american judo team in the olympics.

jeffrey how are you. how's the family okay.
and that's what cigarettes are for.
the straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with sandefur was a compound called coumarin. when i came on board at b&w they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste and had been unsuccessful. i wanted it out immediately. i was told that it would affect sales so i should mind my own business. i constructed a memo to mr. sandefur indicating i could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew we had documentation was similar to coumadin a lung-specific carcinogen
most certainly.
my co-counsel ron motley and i have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the state of mississippi to get the state reimbursed medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness. if you'd be interested in talking to us we'd certainly like to talk to you
okay. i don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. i was paid well for my work. the health and welfare benefits are good. the severance package is fair. i have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which i said i wouldn't.
oh. right. won't you have a seat.
what a touching story.
well at the moment that'd be me.
who do you want me to kill.
well actually all whores worship the dollar if you want to get technical.
we did not.

yes miles. i accept.
do you want to sleep on it.
hardly. you have six bedrooms
hi.
please. leave the house.
so did i. now pack up a few basics and 
wait. he works for you.
hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
he told me to he said he wanted me to 
he never even asked. he just assumed 
do you know him.
i don't know what his game is. he dismissed every one of ruth's proposals. and sarah we weren't unreasonable.
that stinks. they left you with absolutely nothing. it makes you wonder about the entire legal system. like rodney king.
nothing specific but i'll have my own place soon.
you're not
soon you'll have your own rage.
you're miles massey. you probably don't recognize me. the drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
marylin rexroth. when does she 
 so much for the icebreakers. what're you after ruth.
why only fifty percent ruth. why not ask for a hundred percent.
no. not exactly. it didn't exactly cool. marylin is a knock-out. and very sexy but there's a lot of it out there.
i don't know. i can assume
and she had private investigators assisting her.
she brought my digestive enzymes.
am i mentoring the wrong mentee.
three is not farrow.
don't know. i'd have to see on what you base your claim. i presume you feel you're justified in—
yes i know—but—
smart aren't you. so subtle.
south america.
you'll never do it. you can't do it.
what've you got against king westley.
you're going to finance him i suppose.
please don't shout.
what's the matter ellie. what's wrong.
well what are we going to do about it. where is he.
yes i guess i have. i don't want to hurt anybody any more. i want to get away from all this front page publicity. it suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. i can't walk out on king now. it'll make us all look so ridiculous. besides what difference does it make. i'll never see peter again.
looks like that was his only interest in me. the reward.
are you going to see him.
i suppose so.
been sending her meals in regularly.
ellie. oh she's no responsibility.
why it'll make all the front pages. a spectacular thing like that—
oh yeah.
what happened.
that cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us just up and took it. boy how that baby can run.
i'll report it to the driver. about your bag i mean.
yes.
you're doing a pretty sloppy job of it. here's your ticket.
of course i do. what do you mean—
a dollar sixty. you had four dollars last night. how do you expect to get to new york at the rate you're going.
yeah. i got a name. peter warne.
you'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage.
well i hope you're not going to dictate whom i can talk to.
nope. no complaints.
why you don't have to apologize mr. warne. you'll never know how much i appreciate all this.
king—king westley was in it.
that's father at work what'll i do. peter what'll i do.
you don't have to lose your temper. that's what you told me the last time too. every time i step in to protect you. at the elk's dance[7] when that big swede made a pass at you—
oh you are. who made you the manager.
never. i'll get to new york if i have to starve all the way.
must be some strange power westley has over you women. how do you expect to get there.
aren't you afraid of me.
i wish you'd stop being playful.
and rich people have none of those qualifications i suppose.
i don't want it now.
carrots.
what about money.
that's swell.
why don't you stay and watch the fun. you'll enjoy it immensely.
compared to you my friend shapeley's an amateur. whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this. you're positively the most conceited—
in about fifteen minutes.
what's the matter. where's your husband young lady—
why he'll be back.
seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
yes.
hey—you not up yet. come on—come on.
what's 'at.
did you know he reversed the charges on that call.
a thousand dollars. get out of this office before i throw you out bodily.
to tear down the walls of jericho.
i'd put you there myself.
when you sober up—come in and see me.
listen man—i'll tell you what i'll do. when i come back in the morning i'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit. what do you say.
ain't got a hat—
yeah.
yeah. you know one of those toy things. they sent me to the store to get it.
then—you'll have to git .
huh.
if you wanna get anywhere nowadays you gotta keep in touch with all the news is what i always say.
that's right.
susie watch the language would you please.
well what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
did you speak to oswald in dallas.
hell no. i told this bertrand cat right off this isn't my scene man. i deal with muni court i'm a hack in nigger town that kid needs a hot dog.
the fact is he's gone chief and so's our case.
clay bertrand is clay shaw. the guy who used to run the international trade mart.
and that's where you met oswald for the first time.
what the hell's a communist like lee oswald doing working out of banister's.
i'll go you one better. maybe oswald didn't even pull the trigger bill. the nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on november 22nd. and on top of that they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
no i did not.
no i did not.
dave.
yeah you got it. since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office i'd like an answer from you. did you plant it.
i'm sure you've seen this. perhaps you knew this man under another name.
what was so appealing about houston.
get some rest dave and you'll feel better in the morning. we'll talk then.
there were admirals.
jesus ed from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias. you know that. there's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
i'm scared.
well if they can kill the president they can certainly get me.
he kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots. he was getting hot under the collar and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
don't get sidetracked. how does he get back to the states. that's the point. does he have any problems.
i don't believe it.
no. never heard of him.
i would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
mrs. mercer as a former fbi man it's difficult to accept this.
i can't believe a man as intelligent as earl warren ever read what's in those volumes.
jim what is going on for heaven's sake. you going to stay up all night every night. for what. so you'll be the only man in america who read the entire 26 volumes of the warren report.
that sounds dandy but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on easter day.
nothing is going to happen to you. i won't let it.
that's not why i'm attacking him. you don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
he won and they killed robert kennedy. they shot him down.
one little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
i never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in texas give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
general charles cabell. deputy director of the cia. fired by kennedy in '61 because of the bay of pigs fiasco he moved back to the pentagon called kennedy a traitor. when he came to new orleans to address the foreign policy association you know who introduced him. our friend clay shaw.
allen dulles.
i will not have any damned ultimatums put to me lou. i'll accept your resignation.
i sometimes feel things've gone downhill since john kennedy was killed senator.
some people would say you're paranoid.
kings are killed mr. garrison. politics is power nothing more. but don't believe me. don't trust me. do your own work your own thinking.
any chance of one of them confessing someday.
don't think so. when they start to drool they get rid of 'em. these guys are proud of what they did. they did dealey plaza. they took out the president of the united states. that's entertainment. and they served their country doing it.
got promoted to two stars but he was never military you know always cia. went to vietnam lost his credibility when we got beat over there retired lives in virginia. i say hello to him when i see him at the supermarket
i don't know if i should talk about this.
if you buy what you read in the paper.
anyone else involved at banister's level.
yeah. that's it. i don't know. maybe it wasn't. i gotta go.
less than you would guess. most days two to three assistant d.a.'s. a handful of police investigators.
and what would i have to do.
hello. is this jim garrison's daughter.
i need some information from you then. how old are you.
no that could not be done mr. ruby. there are a good many things involved in that.
can i help you.
tomorrow i'll talk to your probation officer. karen's a good kid but she's mad at you because you lied to her. this business about your grandmother's funeral
won't forget.
how old is that machine gun shit.
naw man. i gotta be someplace. i was kinda hopin you could come with me.
well i'm sorry man but i ain't gittin' in that trunk.
i ain't doin' you no way. i just ain't climbin' in that trunk. i got a problem with small places.
does he have the marked bills on him.
she wants to make a deal.
you have the right to say no. and i have the right to make you wait here with ray while i go get a warrant. and if i don't want to go through all that trouble i could just take you in on suspicion.
my pocketbook.
what's in it.
let me have a word outside with agent nicolet for a moment.
what's her name.
can i see your i.d.
can we stop for cigarettes.
it's okay. it's a cop hangout.
is it dark.
what's your brand.
davidoffs. i get 'em in mexico. they're hard to find here. i was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
what have they told you.
what did they want to know.
with ten thousand. nine.
whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. this ain't solvin' my problem. i gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. i'm off today but if i can't leave the country i'm out of a job. and if i don't got a job i can't hire a lawyer.
if you're having some.
he called you.
why.
well hello.
i'm old enough to be her father.
they seem to like the idea.
make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
right around here in the food court.
i'm helping him bring his money into america. he loves the idea. you just missed him.
he was here.
has he hinted around.
he weren't bullshittin' either 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
what do you do when he comes home.
which one.
well you know i'm not going to show him the whole amount. he'll see fifty thousand.
that's why a.t.f.'s gotta make the case. i'm their witness. they wouldn't have a case without me. if it's his word against mine who are they gonna believe.
so how do we give ordell to nicolet.
uh-huh.
only this isn't a bail bond max.
i'm fifty-five-years old. i can't blame anybody for anything i do.
oh miss brown.
we'll just be a minute.
how can you help us.
and splittin' with her.
she told you that.
you didn't. i would think with all this on your mind you'd wait till after.
we had our agent on you. she sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a robinson's/may bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. the white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
sure.
you know how easy it would be. he won't be anywhere near that mall. pull one more switch up front. that's it. half-a-million dollars. need help.
it looks good on you.
what the hell you doin'.
now baby that's got nothin' to do with you. i just carry that. you been listenin' to them cops too much.
baby i ain't come here she shoves both guns in ordell's back.
baby i didn't 
if you want.
but you don't.
uh-huh.
what'd you care.
designer clothes.
where you gonna be during all this.
max cherry. you and him friends now. you tell him about this shit.
i was pretty much the same height now as i was then.
with ordell.
you been to japan.
you lived in japan when.
yeah that really hit the spot.
is it dead.
see what did i tell you. man in new york wants a 9 millimeter smith and wesson model 5946. why does he want it. it's the gun that nigga on new york undercover uses. because of that nigga i can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
sure.
what's your relationship.
i still don't understand why you keep her around.
uh-huh.
when i see you. pick me up at sam's. you count the money.
so what you left her there.
couldn't talk to her.
you couldn't just hit her.
how much it there.
how long was she in there.
where you shot her.
if there were nothin; in here but towels maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and a.t.f. got it. but she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
i didn't really think anything of it. no i did wonder what he was doing there but didn't think it had anything to do with us. you know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
hell yes they know each other. he bonded her out of county.
how can i help you.
yeah.
so you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. what've you got for collateral.
you don't say.
possession of unregistered machine guns.
across the street a great western. it goes in a trust account. you'll need to fill out an application for appearance bond an indemnity agreement a contingent promissory note. that's the one if beaumont skips and i go after him you pay the expenses.
that's what the police thought. i told them i'm unemployed how could i have anybody work for me. now i bail out jackie i'm liable to have the police on me again huh. wanting to know was she doing things for me was she bringing me that money.
was she.
why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand.
man you need to look at this with a little compassion. jackie ain't no criminal. she ain't used to this kinda treatment. i mean gangsters don't give a fuck but for the average citizen coupla nights in county fuck with your mind.
falsely accused of intent. if she had that shit and mind you i said if it was just her shit to get high with.
where is it.
you still there.
how the fuck did he find me.
she wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. she also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
jackie didn't trust melanie. she'd already tried to get jackie to go in with her split the half million amongst themselves. what she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
it's in the safe. she can't get at it.
i know where it is.
she starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. it's somewhere else and we can go get it. i'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. then i'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap find out where my godamn money is. i go walkin' in there and that nigga winston or anybody else is in there you're the first man shot understand what i'm sayin'.

she says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
what. she threw me out remember. she wanted some professor to carry her far away from brooklyn. only we didn't make it. she can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
her problem is that you spent eight years getting a phd and then went to work for the post office.

i don't know. i just liked being your friend. i sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
no thanks. i'm off pills.
wise move. i know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. she took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at ridgedale mall and she was like blaaaaah. i'm a kraken from the sea.

that's her. that's vanessa loring.
you sound shocked or something.
almost eight. you wouldn't believe how weird i look naked.
you're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.

why do people think yellow is gender- neutral. i don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
i don't know. there's just things i still want to do.
looks like it yeah.
you can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.

you just smile let me do all the talking.
thank you for what. what are you thanking me for adele.
what's wrong with her.
you gonna talk to the people who did those murders.

what did he sound like on the phone.
bitch bitch bitch.
apprehensive. let's not forget these are the people who banned the mapplethorpe show. anyway california's loaded with galleries.

i hate 'em.
slow.

remember eventually revenge is carefully have you tired juxtaposing the words.
it isn't him. frank you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
hello peter.
to get your attention.
why did you write remember on the wall.
why not.
if it's so important why don't you just tell me.
you're groping. i have been fair. it's my move now.
i know where you are.
1985. hans korshaud.
what scars.
okay. nice meeting you.
what is it dad.
only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to sanderson for some case you're working on. what'd he do.
each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
we can't rely on your judgement anymore.
he's using the map as a chessboard. the sonofabitch is playing chess with me.
did you send the car.
then i'll transpose.
just thought you might want to talk.
no.
bainbridge books.
i've always wanted to learn how to play chess. i don't have the patience for it. when did you start playing.
sounds very violent.
it's going to be a long night. it could take hours before we know something. you should try to eat.
no. but i'm open to distractions.
you always want to talk about me. what about you.
i dunno. where's erica mother.
i'm just trying to get to know you peter.
nobody could attack you. you set your life up like one of your chessboards. you're impregnable but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses. you're cut off from everyone around you.
i thought you said the line was busy.
nothing.
for emphasis.
what.
that's still no excuse. you treat everything like a game.
it's not that easy.
if we could just figure out what the next word is going to be. he said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
frank told me.
you don't understand. i'm just so <u>relieved</u>. i was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
me too.
mine was worse: i dreamt you picked your nose in public.
take off your clothes. i'm going to scrub you down.
lyssa 
in the arctic ice.
your powers are greater than you know. have you ever seen one of these.
reach out farther. call to her.
yes. each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains sometimes in the jungle sometimes the desert sometimes the sea. never in the same place twice.
she can't see out. she can't tell us where the fortress is.
the deeper she goes the harder it is to contact her. once she is below the second level you will not be able to reach her at all.
<u>why</u>.
no. we will find another way to locate the fortress.
lyssa. <u>why</u>.
no. she must agree of her own free will.
you're coming with us.
blast. a thousand miles off course. well i was rushed. there was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. the foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. what did he expect.
how did you know i had sons.
and in the few seconds before i dice you to crow-food tell me why i am going to follow you.
it should be an interesting journey then.
they burn many villages. even walled cities fall to them.
forgive me my friends. i saw terrible things.
go join them.
well it is true that if i received a royal command i couldn't very well disobey it could i.
a venison pie as big as a house.
bread is for peasants and wine makes me sneeze. got any gumdrops.
i only want one.
i don't think it's working.
we meant only to please you.
what are you doing with my dear. stop. thieves.
many villagers are hiding in the forest. they need food.
my spells always go wrong when i am observed. be gone.
the one with red eyes was a dark one the other was a cyclops and it was not you he meant to kill.
he will come for me.
it is the time.
the widow of the web.
each to his fate lad.
go now. quell was wise. he knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
but you would not stay with me.
power you have given me. what can my power give you.
no.
it will not help.
you will come with me.
what's that man's name.
he forgot his money my mother's got a pub behind the corner and he forgot his money about 100$.
good what are you going to do. do you come back.
i can't believe it. yes i think how she kids me. i can't believe it. and did he pass your threshold or not.
you moved too didn't you.

well i don't need them
130 140
wow. it's brilliant.
mathilda. may i come in.
why don't you take me with you. i'm ready now. you said i learn very quickly.
why.
mathilda.
risky business isn't it.
you're young mathilda you still have a chance to get out. you can't give up this chance. you have to protect it. there's a lot of things to do in life a lot of other jobs
that's awful. i hope you killed that asshole.
maybe it's the time to do something isn't it.
huh that's good.
huh. are you alfredo's son then.
yes twice.
do you recognize him.
may we have this wolf's name and address.
i'll make it.

i've all ready gone six hundred miles i can't do it again.
nothing's going to happen.
then it'll have to wait until i finish.
a.p.b. he isn't breaking any law. he's a grown man he can crawl on his hands and knees to china if that's what he wants to do.
honey i told you. if it makes you happy we should just do it.

sera what you don't understand is
very well umm i never expected to have to ask you this again but how did our evening go. i remember getting to the casino i remember kissing you that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
that's impressive. how did you do that.
very creative. now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
please.
years ago in la i turned a trick on sunset and western. the guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. he parked his car and i took him to a house that i had an arrangement with. a fat mexican woman was watching a tv and i told him to give her the twenty for the room. there were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. the room had a bed and a dresser. he lay on his back on the bed and i put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then i eased on to him. about twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. i felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and i offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes but he said it was all right and began dressing. when we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. he gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. i remember being relieved that i wouldn't have to work again that evening.
i like it here with you.
how'd this happen.
yes that would be great. are you her for the convention.
it is after all sera my money.
have you told anyone that i'm here.

were the princess lili to join me i would sing till my lungs burst.
might not need a gesture quite so grand. what were you doing the very moment the baron's curse fell on the world.
by the pond. she was teasing me.
and did you.
i'll try.
but you did you did.
i may have said perhaps
oh fie. what about the unicorn.
a gentleman would offer water.
what shall we do.
don't leave me now. i fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
he'll not flee if i show myself.
they tricked you.
he did run.
a maid must beware of flattery methinks you want to kiss me.
do you wish it jack. wish you this our wedding band.
oh. green jack. what a dream i've had proper nightmare.
grand champion is it. and what great cause leads you to me.
we seek the ogre baron couer de noir. he slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
how do i get the horn back.
nay. tempting as your invitation be. tell me one thing more.
as fair as me.
i'm partial to oaks as are all faerie folk. mayn't i come visit sometime.
heading north still.
praise be to god.
haven't heard a bird sing in days
forgive my blood haste jimmy squarefoot but i want no more surprises from couer de noir.
i put him to work.
why. what do you mean.
can you keep sam straight.
you have to ask like that.
i'm supposed to be in tahoe.
he's a freak.
i can't even take a shower here.
he asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
what you think you know doesn't have much to do with reality. i mean i hope i'm not the first to say that about you.
why is that.
are you guys' friends.
mr. stevens. one of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height. he's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
how's your wife.
she didn't really say.
this has got to stop.
you were the only neighbor i could tolerate.
the whole summer man. party in tahoe.
i don't know.
probably in the bible.
i'm not doing it.
where are you going.
the gloves on the table are for you.
i was holding for someone. that wasn't even mine.
i took some of your vicodin.
i'm telling you now.
i would have killed him.
after everything he did to you and your mom.
i still don't know what that means.
ah. oh.
mr. dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
lock the door behind you.
you didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat.
i love those doors.
forget it really. i'll survive.
i used to live here.
i was here six years. and i only hated two.
it was just that maybe the way the sun struck the ocean the sound of the waves. it was simple whatever it was. then i started thinking about the last time i felt this good. it's been a long time.
i kind of said that maybe they could do something. help. i'm sorry. they really wanted to come. i really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me. i don't think they'll be too much trouble.
let's see if you've gotten any better.
do you know alyssa thinks something is up with us. she's giving me crap about being away from peter and now you're trying to do the same thing. what no one seems to realize is that peter isn't there. he's not there. and when he is he isn't. so if you don't want me here or you don't want my kids here just tell me george. i'll stop coming. but it won't be because of peter. it'll be because you asked me to stop. say what you need to say because i'm not leaving until i hear it.
that thing about i was the most you know beautiful person you had ever known. what was that.
i'm married.
back. neck. back.
does alyssa know.
what the fuck.
we've eaten.
i'm helping george build his house.
i've been helping for the last few days. weeks. sam's working. i told you sam was working. i mean he really is.
i can't go right now.
we haven't been away together for three years. what difference does a few months make.
you can't go with me because of sam.
that sounds pathetic doesn't it.
you never really trusted me.
you don't look like you.
the door was open.
nothing r okay.
she'll be fine. she just had a bit of a shock.
these are free papers.
not for me it ain't.
crawford's are always looking for new talent.
maybe you didn't notice but this is a prison.
yo blocker what's going on here.
but this is where the action is and i have to be where the action is. look when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes didn't i come through for you. ain't she stepping in style now.
yes boss.
it's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
i got it boss.
for the kind of money they charge here you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
come on honey let's get out of here.
that's because i've never been here before.
i don't see where that's any of your business.
come on daddy-o. you haven't said a word since we started. least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
no tell me what's so funny.
at some point a man's got to get serious about his future. i'm sure you have no idea what i'm talking about.
my daddy gave me this watch.
there is no boom-boom room.
don't get all agitated on me. i bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes i heard 'em talking
she's in a tight spot. her mama needs this operation and they ain't got the money for it. their church took up a collection but they were still short

they're called pilots. i'm serious ray. i'm not in the mood for one of your stupid fucked-up plans right now.
maybe you're fooling yourself ray. maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
after all these years of blissful silence i almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
i know but since we're talking i thought i'd mention it.
some faces you just don't forget. warren pike's is one of 'em.
we'd be in the hole by now. hey man you're peeing on my shoe.

right. and as far as household items: we can share the soap but we'll split the cost 60/40. cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy. aren't you boiling in that outfit.

exactly four steps now. let me lead you. now to the right. it's narrow here you'll have to get behind me.
how will they know we're coming.
some kind of breeding pens i suppose they say people used to breed animals fish anything to eat of course.

yeah. give ya a boner.
okay well i'll see ya then.

yeah how ya doin' pete.
you're doin okay. that's good pete.
what's goin' on.
what night.
what else about that night. did anything happen.
where'd you come from.
fossils huh.
found in asia.
this is the only thing i was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
yeah i remember. you said that before.
don't call me brother.
wait a minute. is it a good morning. say we're supposed to be traveling east aren't we.
you were asked to have a glass of wine. sit down.
i'm going to sleep in my bed. come on lovey.
oh my isn't that pretty. what is it.
hey hurry up you slow-pokes - i'm starved.
you see. you get the idea. from this reservoir here i can pipe in the whole works. oh i'm going to get a great kick out of this. of course it's just to keep my hand in but with the equipment we have here i can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. can rig it up in no time. do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water.
huh.
no.
i think i'll stick around. i'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
you know that's the fourth time you've said that today. you should have a record made of it.
oh good heavens no.
our valley is very rich in a metal called gold which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. so we merely . . .
well they didn't actually mean that.
forgive me. i should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. climate diet mountain water you might say. but we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. in your countries on the other hand how often do you hear the expression he worried himself to death. or this thing or that killed him.
the high lama arranges everything mr. conway.
young. she arrived here in 1888. she was 20 at the time. she was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. the whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
i've offered you some warm broth. i thought perhaps-
ungrateful fool . those were my very words to myself last night. here are these people in shangri-la doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and i haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation.
oh immediately.
oh thank you. thank you.
do you mean to tell me you want to leave shangri-la.
yes of course your brother is a problem. it was to be expected.
did i say if.
that's what you said.
what's on your mind bob. you talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
i'm afraid the porters are just a myth. i guess we never will know why we're here or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
what about the porters.
why not. what's going to stop me.
i don't know what you're talking about. you're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. if you'll only tell me about it.
so you think it's all nonsense huh.
you can't take her away from here.
i've already asked them. they're afraid to make the trip. we'll have to send an expedition back after them.
good.
as a matter of fact all i saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
i'm sure of it. just as i'm sure there's a wish for shangri-la in everyone's heart. i have never seen the outside world. but i understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. yet i just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security where there's beauty and comfort where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. oh i just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
excuse me–
i'm sorry. i haven't even got any cigarettes left.
i'll make some for you. you will come today.
please say you will. the days are so very long and lonely without you. please . . .
so this door. it's not an exit .
it's easy. you work your way up the secret service one day stand with the president meet the most important people on the planet fulfill your dreams live happily ever after.
hell of an assistant isn't he. damn guy moves so fast he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
look. i don't know why. i could guess however. maybe it's your attitude. or that you're not even close to a team player. or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
what. who the hell are you.
well how about if i guess then. black: vast space. deep. spiritual. the essence of infinity.
it's a bug.
i know that's usually the only time i actually have a shot. and what if i wanted to see her again. i'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
if you don't have anyone to tell you won't tell anyone. believe me you get used to it.
what's this.
i dunno. why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner.
how does that help me.
since how long.
and i almost got digested. it goes with the job.
oh yeah well you know. i'm a big fan. i've read all your work.
right right i like that stuff.
it's coming.
so now what. cattle call again.
we're from scientific american. we read about your discovery. we'd like to take a look.
how's dee.
highway 119 just west of smith. why.
hard to tell. i hope not.
a good question. and a simple answer. no more hunger. no more smog. no more overpopulation. no more war.
please i want to go back
i can't leave. you said so yourself there is no minority report. i don't have an alternative future.
why.
can't you see. she just wanted her little girl back.
she died.
what 
that's comforting.
don't worry lamar.
yes sir.
what if danny witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run.
somebody named leo crow.
i can't. they're following me right now. they'll meet me there. they'll halo me.
you can't run 
seventeen minutes.
uh sir
the mall.
look at the kid. in this one he's on the left of the man in the suit.
sir.
but you call this room the temple.
flaws.
you set me up
you gonna tell on me.
she was looking right at me.
rufus for christ's sake get up.
stop 
it's a little late for that.
sean 
i was looking for you
it floated back up. i had to take him out and 
but you have to. they said you would.
look i've put my family through enough misery. you gotta kill me. this way i can leave 'em something.
you say some of the children died.
not if i stay away from him.
why.
i said the record is destroyed. the original report exists for all time. i designed the system so that whenever a report occurred it would be stored in a safe place but not declared.
if you have one.
how do i even know which one has it.
he just wanted a few minutes before 
sir the press conference is starting.
he came to see you yesterday. right before he got tagged. what did you talk about.
none of your damn business.
good god. what was that.
yes it's called an echo. the act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the precogs.
he's trying to prove his innocence.
who.
i don't have any sugar either.
you ever heard him mention the name leo crow.
that was our apartment.
to prevent a murder. sooner or later he's going to contact you.
i haven't seen him in two years.
what does he want with a precog.
what do you think. so he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
you're bobby right.
martel's and coke. one ice cube. in a snifter this time.
we have snifters
what's 'incidentals.'
just tell me. wait here do you have change of a hundred.
so wait you're from where.
i don't know about you guys but i'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
you think he don't know. i give him his cut of seventeen hundred i think he knows i can't make that lap dancing.
chloe.
i gotta go baby. i love you. tell mommy i called. you be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
so what kind of gig is this.
some favor. i hope they know you're not like wendy.
you shouldn't. he likes you.
listen to me bobby. this is my job. it puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
don't you get it. i don't want to leave. this is who i am.
take her.
what's your record at.
yeah well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
how bad is it.
this one.
yeah. the blaze. i bought her in '66. hired a trainer stall whatever it was. that horse made me over a hundred grand. in 'sixties' dollars. you know what that is today.
a million. easy.
they're fucking yeshiva buchas. you didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. you knocked out a guys teeth.
that prick tried to get jessica to blow him in the bathroom 
i'll work it off.
i got a way we make everybody happy.
ricky. ricky 'i lost the truck' ricky.
we get it. we're sorry.
where's the drop.
you're going to the soho grand hotel right.
ricky's taken care of.
we're supposed to meet him here. is ruiz on the list.
that's not what you said. you said if you didn't have a winning record 
don't be shitty.
i'll page you.
ask if he said anything to her.
we need guns.
no. you've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
we look good this year.
i like it.
why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
right here's fine.
see man. maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. beats cleaning carpets.
shhh hello room service.
c'mon man
great. on my fucking room.
ricky who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. we gotta make it last.
what are you doing.
they said a hundred thirty-fifth and twelfth.
they asked who it was.
motherfucker
relax. i'll do right by him. you know that.
he woulda told us right.
did you hear what he just said.
we don't need guns.
this is horseshit. it coulda been so easy.
let's just go get guns i'd feel better.
don't fuck around. you're gonna get us all killed.
ugh
yeah sure. how much are they.
it means you got a gun.
so we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything.
ow shit
well he ain't gonna be around no more.
no shit.
how's it going.
i i just hired these guys to watch my back
the soho grand.
yeah.
sure. you boys want anything.
yes. you're going to new york.
what about my keys.
you can carry your keys. you will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. you will not speak to anyone while you are working. when you are not working you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. this means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. there is already a number in your pager's memory. it is a car service. when they ask you what account you will respond: 'cardiff giant.' they will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. in other words there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. do you see a pattern forming.
i get it.
what motherfucker. you drinking 'the witch' after dinner.
what the fuck was you told. don't talk right.
what they call you.
when.
you know it.
and every cat's watching ain't they. it's a toe-down.
i don't know. it doesn't matter. the thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
like what. looking like me. like a nigger. why don't you want to look like what you are. what makes you ashamed of being black.
sure burn yourself pain yourself put all that poison into your hair into your body trying to be white.
the question is who are you. you are in the darkness but it's not your fault. elijah muhammad can bring you into the light.
what you sniffing around for. i told you i gave you your last fix.
i respect myself. a man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
that's bullshit. that's a white man's book. ain't all these white man's books.
i can't.
 the hardest and the greatest.
 the hardest and the greatest.
is the program ready.
next week brother minister.
i'm in detroit.
i think so. can you catch a plane.
it won't be easy.
it will be rough.
i'm not made of glass.
both women in their 20's charged they had had intimacies with elijah muhammad since 1957
i'm not interested in personal publicity. our people know what i'm doing.
why don't you just ask your question.
mr. x is a demagogue. he has no place to go so he exaggerates. he's a disservice to every good law-abiding negro in the country. can i ask you a question.
did you see the papers today.
mind your own goddamn business she comes in a lot.
 there is a serious question as to whether 
how many you turning out.
thank you brother; sister how are you.
no. you'll be marked for death.
you evil this morning.
baby i was gonna give it to you.
hey man gimme some skin.
except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
i forgot to tell you i'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
only a pig could do a thing like that.
this is malcolm our new guest. we'll treat him like a brother.
the last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
a lot of people are looking for you.
another favor get me banking info on jordan kalfus. u.s. deposits or withdrawals. thanks. oh get me the same on samuel ramos.
i show you give me the information.
[what's the pin number.]
[the what.]
[who's the boss.]
[what money.]
[i don't know. we work in parts. a voice calls in a kidnapping. we deliver the target to the guardians. we don't even know them. they might transfer to other guardians. the negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. they just make the deal.]
[yeah. yes.]
when did mexican customs start getting smart.
not for eight months. i was in columbia looking around but nothing seemed interesting.
how long you staying crease.
well you'd have to keep it under control.
a bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. willing to talk. i'm not good at that.
samuel ramos. owns one of the plants in juarez. the jap car industry is in the toilet. he's trying to persuade ford to partner with him. i think he's in trouble. he asked me if i knew anyone he could trust.
where are you from creasy.
someone gave him more money than we could.
i'm a bargain.
you're fast.
it hurts.
what did you do in asia. is that where you met the man with cigarettes.
good things happen too creasy. like meeting me.
i'm sorry.
that's not a question.
don't be a baby. you're tougher than that.
dyslexic.
no.
look. maybe this isn't going to work. maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone more sociable.
i don't believe you.
you're lying. i don't believe you.
i have a policy aig. it covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days without a bodyguard i will not be able to renew it.
you should be sleeping baby.
yes mom.
you do.
i think he's been sick. he's alright now but i think he's been very very sick.
a man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. only the amount matters.
i'm only asking for one thing. and it's not an extravagance. it's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
it will be a hard break.
you just said it. he's my friend. nothing else to say.
you helped him get this job.
she's all right andy. it's just that i get one saturday night off every three weeks and i was expecting something better that's all.

all right i'll see you.
hey. what are you doing here.
oh.
i cry a lot too. i'm a big cryer.
so there you are. so i guess i'm not such a dog as i think i am.
there's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
well i wouldn't call it an elegant profession. it's in a lower social scale. people look down on butchers.
yes i know.
waddaya doing tomorrow night.
i'll wait for your call.
waddaya doing new year's eve.

it's not a lie. nickels and dimes. to stuff into their own pockets. you can read all about it in the newspapers there.
let go of me. this man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building. he was paid to say so. do you deny that.
oh.

corporate fingerprints all over it.
the only way to eject it is from the inside.

alpha. is there any way we can defeat this monster. any way at all.

i told them it was too dangerous but they wouldn't listen.
there seems to be some confusion about your registration. i believe i can find you a place at the ambassador. many persons of the jewish faith find it quite
what you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. ya know if i keep on killin' people like i have i won't have no more friends left.

boo-boo.
are you frightened.
i came into this world flat on my ass.
shane was a friend of yours.
when you're investigatin' how long ya keep at it.
bastard didn't even show.
he's hidin'. word's out tommy reina's goin' over ta maranzano.
well
you here with bobby.
come on. it's christmas. at least stay for breakfast.
you could have stopped him.

who'll make the rules.
charlie i'm from the old country and these american ways get me sometimes confused. you tellin' us you refuse the title of boss of all the bosses.
well good. woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
how soon can we pull this off.
tommy reina's gone over to maranzano but so far masseria ain't lifted a finger

tommy tells me that capone's coming in from chicago.
and what went on your little party in atlantic city. i got ears.
how can i trust you when you look at me like that.
every successor will owe his loyalty to us. together we take out maranzano and each family gets a piece of his operation.
if you give him the chance lansky will betray you like judas.
they do what i tell 'em.
and if i had known i would have warned you to expect this. we could have prepared.
we were overdue to get hit.

kid - didn't they tell you about this party.

saundersit's going to go pretty bad for jeff tomorrow. there's only one thing that can be done for him now ii've written his resignation. he resigns under protestdenying all charges. no one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. it leaves him with at least a shred of honor. the other waybranded openly in the senateexpelledhe'll never live it down. rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. in a yearthe whole thing might be forgotten
do you.
all right*yes*. and what does that make me to him. *nothing*. i've got to go about my own businessand forget it.
jimsuppose we didn't try to go through with this willet creek dam suppose we postpone it until the next session of congressor drop it altogether
well at the expense of some of the furniture susanyou've made another conquest.
mr. president
senator paine.
he's still pixilated.
any children.

you fainted.
feel better now.
mmm it tastes so good. mr. deeds i don't know how i can ever thank you.
i told 'em i'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
uh-huh.
now what do you see.
what's that.
yeah i know.
he did.
my unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
why. why do we have to do it.
listen babe - get me some stuff on this guy and you can have—
with pay.
had the boys follow us.
good. good. stay there. don't show your face down here. i'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. they'll never know where the stories are coming from. stick close to him babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. we'll have the other papers crazy. babe i could kiss you.

well he passed on. he was killed in a motor accident in italy.
you're going to new york with us.
it's merely a suggestion. i don't wish to press the point mr. deeds but if you'll give me your power of attorney we'll take care of everything. it'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
i think you ought to give this matter some thought mr. deeds.
i mean about the power of attorney.
you're not my attorney yet mr. cedar. not till i find out what's on your mind. suppose you get the books straightened out quick so i can have a look at them.
that's very kind of you. are you related to him.
well we'd like to find out something about him. what does he do for a living.
oh it'll do in a pinch.
well whenever i run across a funny name i always like to poke around for a rhyme. don't you.
there once was a man named cobb who kept semple away from the mob. came the turn of the tide and semple - he died - and now poor cobb's out of a job.
jim mason. oh yeah. yeah. no i didn't send it. i've got it written out though. here it is. arthur's been with the tallow works too long. stop. don't think we should fire him. longfellow.

the sun turning black.
do you realize we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
how do you know the box pertains to hamunaptra.
yeah i was there.
you swear.
did i miss something. are we going into battle.
oh my god it's a preparation room.
how.
egypt is in my blood. my father was a famous explorer he loved egypt so much that he married an egyptian. my mother. who was quite an adventurer herself
got guts lady.
right right in a big underground treasure chamber. everybody knows the story. the entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. on pharaoh's command a flick of the switch. and the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
you told me you found it on a dig down in thebes.
i'm your sister.
ummm hootash im hootash im now what is this last symbol here.
you're welcome to my share of the spider webs.

who's here.
damn-it. that's two down and only two to go.
we gotta get her back.
i guess you know just about everything don't you lance.
and you can't count horst buckholtz anyway.
have you considered my offer.
thanks for reminding me which team i'm on.
hi.
curiosity.
why.
so how do you know that you've ever been invisible.
maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
or flowers.
so where's the art.
the who.
i can appreciate what your majesty is saying but the emperor has staked everything on this policy. he has no other way to attack england and no one knows more than your majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
i have no doubt that he has your majesty but does he have any strong moves from which to choose.
i must confess he would look a bit silly fighting his way to moscow and turning right around again.
proceed.
what do you think napoleon will do.
and what a delightful idea.
what do you mean.
ah my dear friend come in come in. please sit down.
we expect an attack on the convention tomorrow morning at daybreak and i have been placed in charge of its defense.
are you serious.
any cannon.
you could have them here by daybreak.
is this enough to oppose 40000 men.
would you be prepared to handle this for me.
in every practical sense yes but officially of course i would have to retain command.
but sire your majesty would lay paris open to being sacked. the enemy is outside the gates with more than 120000 men. besides this i left the city under the terms of a treaty and i am forbidden to reenter paris.
i believe it was arranged by marshals mortier and marmont. i must explain to you that we have had no orders all day. each marshal has been keeping his own position.
that is incredible.
she was sitting there and it was as if i had last seen her only the night before she hadn't changed she was still the same still completely devoted to me and she told me we were going to see each other again and never again leave each other she has promised me. did you see her.
yes sir i am.
yes sir.
yes sir.
i haven't been there for three years.
i haven't been back for ten years. is your family still there.
why are you carrying the dog.
it is the work of incendiaries.
ah good evening my dear duroc. i'm afraid i've been out hunting and i have had a rather bad fall.
i believe you issued an order that all citizens of paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
this morning a lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons. i explained we had only my late father's sword which in fact was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
no sir.
no not as a rule.
you must be chilled to the bone standing out of doors like this.
is it a nice warm room sir.
only lisette.
oh yes of course. have you met my daughter hortense.
yes we introduced ourselves at the door.
oh i don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
no i'm afraid i never had the pleasure of meeting the general. this sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
no.
yes.
were any of them prettier than i am.
will you be joining us soon.
yes i wrote it.
i couldn't face telling you.
i questioned the maid and she admitted charles had been madame bonaparte's lover for several months.
does she deserve anything better.
that is a matter of opinion.
then do you propose to arrest all of us citizen lieutenant. for i was not there alone.
naw it ain't like that.
if you see that boy again bite off his ear off like mike tyson.
yeah you gotta have a little money to live out here craig. i never thought i'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs. but as soon as i got my check i was gone. paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
me too. you think they're in there.
where's that boy that told me day-day was here.
sorry bro reflexes. how did you do that.
must be nice. i wish we won the lottery. come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
who is that.
you walked.
how can they do this.
no.
thanks for noticing. it used ta be peaceful before they got out. took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.

jungle man fix jane.
thank you comrade thank you.
aren't you late.
too bad you missed an inspiring day anna.
about what.
i see.
ninotchka i wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
are you the buljanoff who fought on the barricades. and now you are afraid to take a room with a bath.
comrades. comrades. don't let's give in so quickly. after all we have to uphold the prestige of russia.
or it might be the firing squad.
and the surprise is there's nothing in it.
we don't like razinin.
we can say whatever we want. we can shout we can complain look the service in this hotel is terrible. see. nobody comes nobody pays any attention. that's freedom.
this is the apartment we have reserved for you comrade yakushova. i hope you like it.
comrades i'm out of the omelet.
with our cream situation what it is it is russia which should apologize to the cats.
a blue shirt perhaps.
i am gaston.
have you.
i want you to know all the white russian exiles in paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. they are very interested in the case. swana suspects her countrymen.
count d'algout
well i think it's getting late. good night ninotchka.
don't call it desertion. our little restaurant that is our russia the russia of borscht the russia of beef stroganoff blinis with sour cream
all right go ahead get her on the witness stand. what can she say.
what proposition.
comrade buljanoff
bad news.
this is comrade kopalski.
a special envoy is coming from moscow. he'll occupy the royal suite. move our things to the smallest room you've got.
yes monsieur.
the same spring we had in paris. just as good.
don't hold that against me please.
on the contrary i don't want to have anything to do with them.
now look here you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in you keep him out.
what.
in other words you don't know.
technical i couldn't help you from that angle. you see a real parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
here here we are here you are and here i am feel it.
i have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. it is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
a russian. i love russians. comrade i have been fascinated by your five- year plan for the past fifteen years.
and what is your profession.
thank you.
you don't have to do a thing. chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
a polish lancer. i was sixteen.
you know i want to
then how did you get here.
your tactics are useless. my name is neither buljanoff iranoff nor kopalski.
why.
then you should go back to your table.
on which boat.
do you like scotch stories.
i'll tell you that joke again. a man comes into a restaurant. did you get that.
he sits down at the table and says to the waiter did you get that too.
comrades. comrades.
darling darling please.
who cried that one.
they belong to the people.
trying to keep me away from you. it couldn't be done. naturally i couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose but i found a way didn't i. darling i had to see you. i wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
did you win.
he's a waiter at the clarence poor devil. you know him.
is anything wrong. are you ill.
make it ice cold.
oh no my little volga boatman. have you forgotten our first commandment: never complain never explain. it has worked so often and so perfectly don't let's break the rule. and please don't look so guilty otherwise i'll
all right i'll listen.
leon. this has the ugly sound of regeneration.
you're right madame it will all be over by thursday.
how stale last night's gaiety looks. it has the taste of a dead cigarette.
madame if you
they always belonged to the russian people. they were paid for with their sweat their blood their lives and you will give them back.
in other words moral ideas have no weight with you all right then let's deal with legal facts. you know that france has recognized the soviet.
good morning comrade commissar. here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
well comrade i am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
where is it.
what is it rakonin. did you lose your job.
no madame something of the utmost importance it concerns your jewels.
mr. president i don't know what to say. as soon as we learned from the secret service you were en route the director was notified. he should be here any minute.
uh huh 
you say john cut our losses and all the rest. but suppose the thing blows and they indict bob and the others. jesus you'd never recover from that john. it's better to fight it out instead and not let people testify 
i'm not going to be the scapegoat for this. haldeman and ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
yes i got the money.
it was her wrist. and it was through a plate-glass door.
'cause he hates you. it's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
i think he means the kennedy assassination.
martha's an idiot she'll do anything to get john's attention. if mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut martha we wouldn't have that kid magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary. was he smoking pot.
mitchell.
oh i suppose you would've just let them take over. these aren't fraternity pranks john. it's anarchy. a revolution.
i don't know if i'd go that far sir.
is the war worth it. is it worth a one-term presidency. because i think right now that's what we're looking at.
we can't touch hoover 
sorry 
no sir you did not.
 an action that will at last once and for all show that what i knew and what i did with regard to the watergate break-in and cover-up were just as i have described them to you from the very beginning 
he's completely lost touch with reality.
can we get around this al.
lincoln used it.
 you mentioned the bay of pigs several times. sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means. they're going to want to know what was on that gap 
it was just a fishing expedition. apparently it was their fourth attempt at the dnc.
i think i think that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that helping the cuban exiles who oppose castro would uh not only be a violation of international law it would be 
i don't understand. track 2's chile.
but hell this is nothing compared to venezuela. when i was vice president ike sent me down there like a blocking back. they threw rocks broke out our windows almost overturned the car. read six crises bob. boy pat was brave.
sir.
i believe you're right boss.
you know why they're turning on me. they're not serious about power that's why. they're playing with power. they're forgetting the national interest. in the old days people knew how to hold power how to set limits. they wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. all they care about now are their egos looking good at cocktail parties 
you played it perfectly sir cocksucker. he's going to think twice before he leaks again.
we've got to turn the faucet off on this thing. it's out of control  you might burden just me with this in the future.
helms wants iran or there might be problems. all of his old cia buddies are over there making a fortune off the shah.
more light chief.
relax dick it's just me the desert's so beautiful isn't it. i want to go home dick. time to go home.
is there something else that's bothering you mr. president.
you're referring of course to chairing the special operations group as vice president.
not joaquin you idiot. nixon. did you hear what he said in oregon. about me having too much power.
i never met the man.
no henry. i don't.
who are you talking to like this you insignificant shit 
you'll pick up the middle on this one - the jews and negros.
but it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
all kinds of shit would come out. like the ellsberg thing. you knew about that henry didn't you.
i i heard something it sounded idiotic.
 uh i hope this doesn't embarrass you.
not at all. this is not going to leak is it.
just uh you know.
we let you down didn't we. your people.
i must say you look very good mr. chairman.
don't ever trust them. they never tell the truth or honor their commitments. vietnamese are like russians. both are dogs.
what are you going to do about this allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in chile. you gonna send kissinger down there.
rocky's full of shit. no way he's going to get nominated west of the hudson with a new wife. he's gonna be drinking scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the republicans.
the jewboy's a harvard whore with the morals of an eel sells himself to the highest bidder.
you need her dick in '60 she was worth five six million votes.

there's a lot more at stake here than what you want. or even what i want 
you know fred they sell tickets.
pows. and their families.
maybe i should get out of the game. what do you think buddy. go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid some money at the end of the line you know i keep thinking of my old man tonight. he was a failure too.
no. i'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
it's over dick.
i'll concede in the morning.
what are you saying. what are you talking about.
we can be happy. we really can. we love you dick. the girls and i
he doesn't want me at the funeral.
then call him. i'm sure it was an oversight.
i don't want them to love me.
i do. i do. in my own way.
i'm not scared buddy. you don't understand. they're playing for keeps buddy. the press the kids the liberals they're out there trying to figure out how to tear me down.
i'm the only left dick. if you don't talk to me you 
howya doin'. new york treating you okay. i'm sorry i haven't been able to see you at all
sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. aren't you exaggerating a bit dick. call it three-and-a-half maybe four 
whatcha predicting your boy goldwater going to split the party.

here's ghengis kunt and the demilitarized zone. get it. they're korean so they're pretty hot.
the fuck you talking about.
did you know the most brutal inhumane prison of the entire war was in georgia.
if we're for real.
are you out of your mind. you scalped him.
well why'd you shoot him.
i wasn't done i was just sick of hearing him whine. and you didn't take him out you scalped him. christ i almost puked did i tell you that.
well why'd you have to tell that indian story.
let me tell you something. in our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. the guys who get the calls are good not flashy just good. they get in they get out. nobody knows a goddamn thing. understand. boom boom boom. three in the head and you know they're dead.
so she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
you think so. joyce says she's timid.
among others.
no i see betty as a midwestern stoic type. ice water in her veins. a clear thinker. probably a swede or a finn.
betty betty betty
so what the fuck's a finn.
it's not an exact science wesley. he said they'll be here my houston contact has always been very reliable.
worse you're in texas.
we should go.
it just didn't fit her profile
i said 'got it.'
i don't like talking bad about the dead but now that he's gone i can tell you she put up with things in that marriage i wouldn't have. and yes she of all people was the one who defended him. and that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
if anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed it would have been me.
this story is beyond belief which is perfect for us. it's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
why would i give a shit how you feel. and i got news for you. i loved your 'icy water' idea the other day i'm toying with the idea of killing david ravell off in a boating accident.
jesus don't do that. if it gets around that you fired me i'll never land a pilot.
ahh mercedes i think. black.
would you say she was ambitious.
mrs. rogers. i'm dwight campbell with neighborly life insurance. i'm looking for betty sizemore.
aren't they precious. ma'am she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. does she have any relatives in the area.
yeah.
once again we find ourselves in agreement. what kind of work do you do big dan.
i like to think that i'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
no they never did turn me into a toad.
it's tommy. they got tommy.
in any state.
pullin' ah pants down
where's your ring honey.
ain't gonna be no weddin'.
not your
or it might a been under the mattress.
you -
well now honey that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
uh-huh.
pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty.
the hell it ain't square one. ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut.
it's awful white of ya to take it like that everett. i feel wretched spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. it's been eatin' at my guts.
we prayed to god and he pitied us.
boys that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. you just sign these papers and i'll give you ten dollars apiece.
holy-moly. these boys're a hit.
it's bona fide.
i ain't never going back to that school sir.

hey what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at trader jon's. come on man. you're about as close to being officer material as me.
i don't want to do something anybody can do.
it's important sir.
see you in the fleet sir.
pardon.
before that.
now when i say understand i want the whole group to say yes sir. understand.
yes sir.
louder.
stop eyeballing me boy. you are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. use your peripheral vision. understand.
uh-uh. not a chance. there's nobody in this town doing anything with his life except what his father did which is nothing. if i can't have more out of life than that i'd rather be dead.
cake walk. both my dad and my brother went through it and made it so i know i can.
vietnam.
i had a big brother who died over there too. he wasn't no flyer though. he was just your basic marine corps type. i was only twelve when it happened so i don't remember much about him.
sid worley i think you're ashamed of me.
ashamed. no i love you lynette. i mean that. after i leave them i'll meet you at the motel okay.
by the way shouldn't you have had a period by now.

wrong. i've driven a hundred and twenty miles told a hundred and twenty lies and said a hundred and twenty hail mary's since i saw you. hungry.
i don't want you to move.
i don't want to move. but somebody has to move sometime. eventually.
i'm so embarrassed. i knew i shouldn't have brought you here.
no it's okay. it was a great free meal. everybody was so uptight i felt sorry for you.
what would you do differently.
hey. you know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games okay.
how do you figure that's your bunk.
the kid on the windy side of the baker's window. that's how he put it.
what's the matter sweet pea. foley finally starting to get to you.
thanks for covering for me.
but she expects you to marry her.
do you know that for sure.
please zack go back to the barracks.
i don't get it. he's the best candidate in our class. ask anyone. the best student. the best leader. the best friend to everybody. couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little.
no problem.
that's your problem.
 posed to mean.
fuck.
keep your voice down.
they're not supposed to be here.
'bout four o'clock.
i hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
push that button for me will you.
we're not gonna do anything about him he's fine.
 seventeen feet wide fifty-five feet deep forty-two hundred square feet four floors with a rentable basement apartment so five altogether courtyard in back 
shoulda got an apartment.

sabu high white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
glad you came man.
you want me to put a man on it.
i want it duly noted that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the oakland police department. the fbi doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations my friend. as i've said before agent rodgers we have things under control in our city
i don't think that will be any problem
wait a second there brother
welcome brother have you decided to get down with us.
i don't know about that.
aw uh it's was just harassment. my driver's license expired.
brimmer.
yeah well they want a lot for their money. they want a felony preferably with violent intent. we've got to give them something. they'll kill me if i don't. and the panthers are going to kill me if i do. i'm scared.
shit we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
sorry man
fuck is up.

chickenshits. what you bring your buddies with you.
rose.
yeah look man what i gotta say. it's just you me and the rats right. alright well sabu's back.
god damn it's him. i gotta go.
you call that a compliment.
it worked. how many men can you raise.
do you.
two pounds fourteen ounces.
what unit.
first virginia regulars under colonel hamilton.
shall we proceed.
let us. unless you object i would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and as such there are certain customary practices. perhaps i could explain them to you
please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
restrain them from the targeting of civilians including women and children.
that is a separate issue.
their names ranks and posts.
the new york and rhode island assemblies have been dissolved
rioting both sides of the bay in chestertown they burned the customs house and tar-and-feathered the customs agent. he died of burns. in wilmington they killed a royal magistrate and two redcoats.
when you have children i hope you'll understand.
what now sir.
these four wagons must be his.
gabriel. are you asleep.
she spoke. susan spoke.
tarleton has a list of our men most are on it. a regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list burning them killing whomever resists women and children as well.
father tell me what happened at fort wilderness.
i don't care. i hate him.
mister robinson i fought with captain marion in the french and indian war including the wilderness campaign. we served as scouts under washington and i have no doubts about captain marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. there's not a man in this room or anywhere for that matter to whom i would more willingly trust my life.
when.
how many men does cornwallis have under his command.
his wife was killed yesterday. she was with child.
for what.
how many came back.
i was sorry to hear about your son.
if cornwallis receives news that clinton is coming he'll simply hold tight and wait. he'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
put those away.
what if you can't read what's written on there anymore.
well it still says some animal got laid down here after don't it.
who is this paxcow. is he like the boogeyman.
i'm not tired.
i'm sure you're not.
excuse me mr. crandalli've got to change this kid. it's nice to meet you.
ayuh i think 'twas. if i see louis come home before i go to bed i'll tell him to
movin' in's mighty thirsty work. i usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. come on over and join me if you want.
you need a glass.
nice.
yes. where are we going jud.
this was their burying ground louis.
doesn't look like they last long.
they buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. then something happened. half the tribe died in a season. the rest moved on. they said a wendigo had soured the ground.
a man doesn't always know why he does things louis. i think i did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
but i think the thought has crossed your mind.
shit. look at this mess.
i'll tell you where the ground is sourthe ground in my heart is sour. let me tell you something else vic-baby: wrong is wrong.
the movers
my god.
i heard you tonight.
that's forgotten.
i know whose blood you need to end the curse.
the pearl. oh that's fine. and just how do you expect this to work.
that's right.
i'll watch my back.
you can go to your grave not knowing.
no i really think i do.
thank you sir.
then why aren't you eating.
i think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
his name is will turner that's all i found out.
commodore i beg you please do this for me. as a wedding gift.
what.
last time i was here a grand total of three days. last time the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by and i bartered passage off. but from the looks of this they've been out of business and so that won't be happening again. we probably have your friend norrington to thank for that.
a month. will doesn't have a month. we've got to do something to help him.
don't be thinking i'm happy about this elizabeth. but i see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which i can do nothing about.
drink up me hearties yo ho 
i know a lot of songs about pirates but none i'd teach a child. let's hear it.
that was before i met one of course.
what are you doing. you've burned our food the shade the rum.
exactly.
i'm going after the black pearl. i know where it's going to be and i'm going to take it.
somewhat.
we're going to steal a ship. that ship.
i worked passage from england as a cabin boy. after my mother passed i came out here looking for my father.
you think your father is the only man who ever lived the glasgow life telling folk one thing and then going off to do another. there's quite a few who come here hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. and they're all 'merchant marines.'
go to the opposite end of the island and signal the ship. i'll keep 'em busy.
there's no *real* ship as can match the interceptor.
he's still breathing.
what happened here.
a moment.
look i don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here but we got a little problem.
but in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period. there will be no way to stop it.
pollution.
the body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air there has been nothing sacred about nature. nature is the enemy mr. o'brien and science is our greatest weapon against her.
it's ready now i know it is.
she let it escape because she wants me to die.
icarus.
did i. i've been waiting for that for years.
then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
dr. makeo is working on it now sir. i estimate at least another six hours.
you have no idea what this is doing to your body.
why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
what did he want.
yeah somebody broke in and stole the samples one of those animal rights groups right. i remember now they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the massachusetts turnpike right.
yeah. but it wasn't a group. it was one man.
what's it smell like.
please susan. i need help. something is wrong with me.
what are these.
why.
pills you know how i feel about pills.
the nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
that's right.
i'm sorry daniel but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized. it's got to mean something.
what's wrong.
the nanobot it's not here
what did you want my hair for.
no cheese.
who is he.
where is it.
susie i
we were different people then.
oh yes you are.
vermin
icky.
yes it'll be a very interesting experiment.
miss wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need miss gallagher.
don't mind mother.
certainly. right over there.
that's a good idea - telephone the police. the number is spring 3100. get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
what do you want.
my name is smith - well that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. i'm white male and over twenty-one. i've never been in jail - that is not often. and i prefer scotch to bourbon. i hate carrots i hate peas i like black coffee and i hate garters. i make seventy-five bucks a week and i've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - i don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
a little—. sure i'll be right up. he's all right. i like him.
got my initials on them too. they're cute. they're nice little things - what do you do with them.
oh no. no no. not me. i haven't worn these things for years.
i thought i was very charming stewart.
will you stop being silly stewart.
but i don't want to meet your gang.
oh hello anne– he types furiously.
now wait don't get excited anne. there's no reason for that. perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. that's all right. i'm sorry. i'll go right down and throw them out. that's no reason for you to take this attitude. after all i certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house haven't i.
your house.
this is something i should have done a long time ago only i didn't have sense enough to do it. no i had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that i knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. but no more. no more. so that's that.
i want to see stew smith. oh excuse me - i mean mr. smith.
pardon me mr. smith is engaged. we are having a reception here this evening—
what's the matter. isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd.
yale '21 i believe.
yeah.
so you see how silly that rumor is.
say take it easy. take it easy. listen my boy. no use you hanging around here. just buy the tribune tonight and read all about it. you can rewrite it for your last edition.
is that so. well have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph.
yeah. the boss sent me over to offer you a job. he wants you to write a daily column on the tribune.
well stew that's all thrashed out. by golly i'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. you know our racket - after all news is news.
yeah.
the one about the siberian bloodhound.
i'm your valet sir. dawson is the name sir.
what are you doing fooling around in here.
i bet.
do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates.
i suppose you know why i came—.
sure.
dexter grayson you told me it was only ten thousand—and you didn't even get those letters from that jezebel.
yes - the worm.
the name is smythe.
but i—
found no skeletons.
i just putter.
hmmm you just putter. do you have to have a putter to putter.
oh no sir. i putter with me hands.
no. well well well. that's all right if you like it. can anybody do that.
a bird in a gilded cage.
what.
thanks i love you.
wait 
i got caught in the storm. you were gone all night too.
i sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight mary sue.
sure is pretty.
what's the matter.
yeah how'd you know.
changes.
and it's important for them to see someone they respect stand up for what's right. if you love a place you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
wellit was dark out 
what do you mean.
david cut it out. mark davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
get lost.
i don't believe this.
just take deep breaths.
no. i'm not gonna do it. if i don't dress like this for mom i'm sure as hell not going to do it for you.
what.
jen listen 
i likereally need a cigarette too.
you can't do this jennifer. i warned you.
you have no right to do this.
i had nothing to do with that fire.
it's okay.
 yeah.
seemed kinda sexy. look. i read 35 pages.
well i've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and i'm still like this. they have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
you got the admissions letter.
no. i baked them for you.
okay whose window did bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs.
scout.
 her father.
right. and how did she dress him.
weil wouldn't you. you look for someone for years you pour your heart into it this is a privilege you know. i don't think i better talk about this right now.
it was a gift bud. it was so special. you liked these things as much as i did remember: warm smells in the family kitchen. a smile from a stranger. you know how rare that is.
because you're coming home. i'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
why.
what.
have you cooked the burgers.
look you can't always like what you do. sometimes you just do it because it's your job. and even if you don't like it you just gotta do it anyway.
you know what i really like.
oh wellyou're just starting out. i mean you can't do it 
it's beautiful.
so you can't talk to me.

 well if you're gonna go 
ok.
yeah. yeah we get along well. you didn't get along with her very well.
yeah.
 the promotion says: buy any 10 healthy choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1000 for purchases made with a special coupon. so in the supermarket you notice their products first you notice they have a teriyaki chicken dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal.but then i noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because i stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. that's those little bar codes you know. the universal product codes.
what happened.
did you pick it up from the street.
so you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought.
have a good trip.
it's barry.
yes.
i'm calling you i'm standing in my hotel room i came because i have my business trip 
you don't have a boyfriend or anything do you.

i think i got in trouble. a little bit of trouble.
hi.
i need to talk to you for a second.
you made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't.i'm here to get the money.

yes. sorry.
this is barry.
are you going to the party tonight.
i'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
they need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their oc.
i'm pleased to have the new post sir.
of course everything's not as harmonious as it seems. i hope you've a strong constitution.
yes well i awoke to discover i'd turned into a cat. if you don't do as i say i'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
to seal the wound he took a poker from the fire 
madeleine 
i haven't been to see the marquis for ages. and i won't ever again i swear it. i won't speak to him i won't even utter his name 
we treat you well enough here don't we marquis. your very own featherbed in lieu of a straw mat. your antique writing desk all the way from lacoste. enough quills to feather an ostrich 
there i was taxed; it's true.
but we also fall in love; we build cities we compose symphonies and we endure. why not put that in your books as well.
what the devil 
 water. 
i didn't create this world of ours. i only record it.
i saw the longing in your eye 
and did you.
you're a man of science; i'm a man of god. charenton stands to profit from us both i'm certain.
all france is aghast at this book yet you've not heard of it.
i've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
on the contrary. let me take up this matter with the marquis myself 
and my own.
yes.
you're more than a priest; you're an angel. ain't he maddy.
is it awfully violent.
i must say in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
the abbe's sending me away. he fears for me here what with the likes of you 
 who'll whisper it to bouchon 
it is customary to write first and request an appointment 
i am not a wealthy woman.
doctor can i impart to you his cruelest trick.
you've no right to assault me in this fashion; i'll call for my footman. i'll have you removed 
how was i to know my darling.
doesn't that please you.
oh but haven't you heard. i'm the boy wonder. i've been a genius since the moment i was born.
it's not so bad here. after all what girl doesn't want to live in a castle.
do you.
elegant words sir when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. in your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. i learned at the knee of the master.
why is that louis.
she's a catholic. she says it would put her soul in peril. divorce is a very serious sin apparently.
there's nothing to explain
you gotta wake up now. pops.
you are being typically theatrical marion. i need the tribune to
yes.
sir.
i want blood
huh.

what have i done.
you know all this nightmare we went through with hearst. the whole thing and in the end probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
they came to me with an offer. 800000 for the negative and all the prints.
rosebud. i'll tell you about rosebud
i know i know. but what more can you expect of me. i have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to.
then find another theater
you're not still mad at me i hope
aw tommy c'mon it ain't that.
j.r. glad you could make it.
no i'm not afraid. why. you wanna meet her.
yeah

ah no no. i didn't bang her. i know her from around here that's all. you want to meet her or what.
do you see her yet.
he fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight
well sometimes you shouldn't listen to me. now i don't know if i can make it down to 155. i'm having trouble making 160 and without telling me you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds and if i don't make 155 i forfeit $15000. you're supposed to know what you're doin'. you're supposed to be a manager.
stick out your hands jake.

i suppose it is.
she wears this gingham dress cooks popovers makes jam in season makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
why did you change your mind about bringing us along.
i don't know. i thought i did. now i'm not sure. i thought it had something to do with me.
you know so much about me figure it out.
all right it's said.
go on take it. then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
maybe it isn't going to sonora but it's going somewhere which is all right with me.
thanks for loading me on the stage. i know now why you did it.
so did i. they were in it.
yes.
why.
you remember jeff rawson. we used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.

go away please.
you got no business snoopin' around 
i saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
there aren't any women here.
some people who went by this way lost it. two men and some women. they packed their stuff on horses and went on.
clay could save us an awful lot of time.
pleased to meet you ma'am. we found your trunk. were you doin' the driven'.

then i know my alphabet.
 and even if i do learn to read what use'll it be. i'm goin' to live on a ranch.
no.
an' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough what's the use of knowin' how to spell them.
and you've got me all figured out.
you were supposed to be reading words.
that's always tough. how long were you together.
actually i just met her. this is alex.
you better be careful. i heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today. hey what class do we have next.
ouch.
yes of course uriah. i feel his evil presence.

come in somebody. can you hear me.
this is ray. what's up. where are you.
morphine. chloroform. horse tranquilizers. you've drugged him.
hanson please.
my child you're alive.
so do you think you made it into the class.
uh uh.
she'd have to be really pretty and i'd have to be very drunk.
are you.
shorty. you're alive. but what about your head.
professor is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something.
i don't like this this
i think she's starting to suspect something.
cindy campbell. classic abandoned personality disorder. she seems guarded but willing to do this.
my god. is she dead.
are you sure it's not the tape.
i don't think so. it's on all the cameras and check this out. the thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
professor we need to talk.
that's why we came here remember.
work work work. is that all that you do.
the professor might have everyone else fooled but i know who the real brains of the operation is.
i'm so glad you're here.
what.
yo son check this out.
fucked me.
i'm totally freakin' dude. i keep having these nightmares then i wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. i can't take it anymore man.
i wouldn't give ya a nickel.
turn right on timonioum road. hurry dad.
mrs. jensen i've told you. you have to rewind the tapes before returning them.
chip honey.
oh god really. this is the limit.
i'm so happy i could shit.
i'm sorry he's dead but have you signed off yet.
don't i get a kiss.
ooh honey i'm ready. now. now.
there's dede. he's my favorite chickadee. he's here every morning for breakfast.
fuck you too you rotten whore.
dottie. watch what you're doing.
socially i'll have a beer.
mrs. hinkle are you insane.
who wants fruit salad.
yummy. carl says if i lose ten pounds he'll take me to the university of maryland fall mixer.
mother. did you hear me. someone murdered carl in the mensroom. i saw his dead body.
he's a good boy.
what is it mr. stubbins.
you forgot something
she did it. aimed the car right at mr. stubbins and mowed him down.
that's a franklin mint piece. eight dollars.
sure i do.
that girl was looking for jacqueline gibson. i'd forget it if i were you.
it's only a little way mr. august.
no.
are you dr. louis judd.
tell me how is jacqueline.
it always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
why.
good.
a job.
don't. we know what happened. don't go on.
no. stay that way. i want to talk to you. i love you -— you know that.
well.
let her know what.
who are you.
yes.
it's terribly sweet of you jason.
it's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars 
don't make me tell you jason.
if it is true — there's all the more reason for you to find jacqueline.
would it be asking too much miss gottschalk for you to get me these books.
i saw you with her last week. i knew you'd be here tonight. where is she.
because there was another girl— years ago a nice girl. she lived on barrow street. i saw her with you once -— i saw her with you twice and then i never saw her again. that's why.
tell me where jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
yes. when i tell you.
i think it's time.
perhaps.
don't be so amazed. it's a very ordinary matter. i'm jacqueline's physician mr. ward told me you were in town and jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
i'm afraid you have mistaken my motive louis. i thought you might understand and sympathize.
i have no sympathy for either good or evil. i have only curiosity a professional curiosity. what unhappy people most of you are.
no you draw no secrets from me as you drew them from jacqueline. you are not one of us yet. you're clever louis but i recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. you are only curious. you have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
is it about jacqueline.
but i'm not coming to you out of deep conviction i'm coming to you out of loss. i no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
but you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
mrs. redi there's one thing —-with jacqueline gone how do you carry on the business. what do you do with the receipts. how do you sign checks.
there's nothing you can think of old letters anything that might give me some hint as to where i might find jacqueline.
i can almost feel your doubt about what i'm saying mary.
but she was here.
that makes it all the more difficult ——
i'm worry to bother you. i want to ask you about my sister.
children i want you to be very good and very quiet while i see mrs. wheeler a moment. she's going to take over this class for a while.
what.
i went back through the history last night. i read about johann rozenquartz i read what he wrote 
i have taken care of mary. i've spoken to her. she's going back to school.
well
why. didn't you know him well.
it's up to you. but i warn you if you tell me something personal i might do the same.
kids. what about them.
yeah actually i do. but john doesn't. at least not right now.
as long as it's not gross you know. like some scar or something. it has to be like mine like something about you.
you're what.
not usually. i mean honestly i haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection so i feel i'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
nothing i can't finish later.
what are these.
can we look at one.
no not to me for me for the camera.
yes. but i sense the element of revenge here.
tell me your name.
did you have sex before you were married.
so you do fantasize.
i fantasized about you.
yes.
can't.
that's correct.
yes.
who was the last person you had sex with.
so you lied to her.
kind of. i mean john's like this kind of craftsman. like he's a carpenter and he makes really good tables. but that's all he can make and i don't need anymore tables.
why not.
but that was part of it.
why are you ashamed.
and i'm telling you it's not any one thing that i can point to and say that's why. it doesn't work that way with people who have problems ann it's not that neat it's not that tidy. it's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. things just don't happen that way.
but why can't you just put it all behind you. can't you just forget it. all that stuff you did.
i want to touch you.
oh we get along okay. she's just very she's an extrovert. i think she's loud. she probably wouldn't agree. definitely wouldn't agree.
yes. i just got busy.
jesus christ where'd that come from. i have a late lunch by myself and now i'm fucking somebody.
there's nothing to know ann.
ann you are completely paranoid. not ten minutes ago i wanted to make love for the first time in weeks and you act like i'm dipped in shit. you know i think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
well this weekend john was taking out the garbage and he kept spilling things out of the container and i started imagining a container that grew garbage like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself and how could you stop that if it started happening.
well last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
what do you mean.
so it was recently that you tried this.
no i haven't.
let me rephrase. were you attracted to him.
what brought this on.
why.
you know what. you say it just to irritate me.
i think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. i think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
well i'll call him when he does.
let me talk to him first.
i don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and
a card. for her fiftieth birthday.
i don't he doesn't want you to come over.
cynthia.
i feel like i do.
that doesn't mean you do. you can't possibly trust him he's perverted.
i think you're right. so come on i came all the way over here to find out what got ann so spooked tell me what happened.
oh okay. i think i get it.
talking.
you just want to ask me questions.
i am now recording. tell me your name.
my first sexual experience or the first time i had intercourse.
no. he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer and then his family moved away. to cleveland actually.
not really. i didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything i thought it would be smooth like a test tube.
what did he say.
prettier than ann.
is that what he tells you.
okay.
ouch. okay i deserved that. cynthia don't you understand. after the first time it's just not spontaneous. there's no edge anymore. look at the tapes there is only one date on each label. i have never taped anyone twice.
i'm sorry. i can't do it.
meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile right.
why.
oh. well when then.
what if this tape gets into the wrong hands.
it won't. i trust him.
you trust him.
look are we going to do it or not.
graham.
no he didn't put me up to this. jesus i don't need people to tell me what i should do. i've just been thinking about things that's all.
where are the tapes graham.
yes.
okay in a minute i'm on with a client.
he'll be really mad.
you're the one who found the bodies.
anything wrong.
right. it's crazy. but here's the beauty part. ready. who cares.
yes.
ok. it's apartment 1009 south tower starliner towers. may as well go there directly.
breaking out
what's cookin' bert.
i detect a note of reticence. are you perhaps one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative.
conspiracy is right. the denton dossier is
really. what'll i pin this on.
some people do it for compassion
you've lost your cause
what are you talking about. danny slepstrini is a chip off the old block. i played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week. and hank says danny's moved to new york. to better himself.
sure thing.
they call it a new look at an old favourite i copied it from the 'window on the world' show. the far east meets the mid-west.
just what the doctor ordered. i know. come on in my favourite show's just started.
poor brad.
oh mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
i need some
you've got a really tight team around you. and everybody needs you.
but what'll i do. what'll i say. what'll i wear.
farley.
f for
this could be the start of a whole new career here
mommy and daddy love you baby.
the problem with that is that then there's one extra 
don't dismiss me. i'm trying to include you in this decision. he's your friend.
i didn't dismiss you. i told you what i thought but it didn't seem to matter so you decide. besides this is supposed to be my time with miles. i hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
and.
how's it hanging miles.
busy night for a tuesday. we had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. usually they're not too rowdy but tonight there was something going on. full moon or something. what can i get you.
she was good for you. and so beautiful and intelligent. you knew her right.
stephanie.
i can't help the traffic.
pinot noir. how come it's white. doesn't noir mean dark.
i liked it a lot. a lot of improvements. it just seemed overall i don't know tighter more congealed or something.
what.
speak for yourself. i get chicks looking at me all the time. all ages.
you still seeing that shrink.
these guys make top-notch pinot and chardonnay. one of the best producers in santa barbara county. look how beautiful this view is. what a day.
yeah but how are they making the salmon. poached with a yogurt-dill sauce. teriyaki. curry.
it's not even a mile.
whoa.
yeah. tight.
have you no shame.
about a month ago. six weeks.
i'm going to be a fucking pariah. everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if i'm going to get drunk and make a scene. plus tony fucking levin.
we're on.
you know how often these pourers get hit on. i'm going for a swim. get the blood flowing. want to come.
and don't drink too much. i don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. do you hear me. no going to the dark side.
where were you.
shut up. shut your face.
we were supposed to play golf.
you go. in fact use my clubs. they're brand new gift from christine's dad. it's on me. oh say by the way stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the hitching post tonight and sit at one of maya's tables and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all 
so tell me everything. details. i like details.
you didn't get any did you. you're a homo.
do you like them.
i'm going to need an operation. maybe a couple of them. they have to wait for it it to heal first. then they break it again.
huh. let me think.
oh no actually. busy night.
well it's a little difficult to summarize. it begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. kind of based on personal experience but only loosely.
what's the title.
the day after yesterday.
mrnmm yeah but not really. it shifts around a lot. like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. and some other stuff happens some parallel narrative and then it evolves or devolves into a kind of a robbe-grillet mystery you know with no real resolution.
oh yeah. who cares. i'm the queen of typos. wow this is really starting to open up. what do you think.
yeah. like what.
hope you like it. feel free to stop reading at any time. i'll take no offense.
no we've got to get back friday for the rehearsal dinner.
i've told him. i've told him over and over but he's out of control.
hello.
yeah he's good that way. very considerate.
i am.
see you miles. you take care.
just now. she's thrilled. and the kids.
well you boys do what you want. i just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
what's the matter.
the same windows.
i will.
i will.
i see.
curse and stuff.
are you going to do this or what.
it's probably picking up another baby monitor.
that wasn't the answer you wanted.
should we make a run for it out the back.
i can feel air.
it's getting stronger.
don't touch him.
graham.
these are d's; i need double a's.
morgan.
oh.
it says they're probably very small like my height because as their brains developed there was no use for physical development. it says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
don't call me father.
let me ask you two something. don't be embarrassed by the answer. it is possible just possible now you might have been chasing each other around. you said you went in opposite directions.
do you owe anybody money. you can tell me off the record if you need too.
there was an accident. drunk driving. they weren't sure.
she's not in an ambulance father.
no money eh.
emmett.
i almost didn't.
more than enough.
goodbye.
maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
i've got my people sitting down there swatting flies and raring to go.
two of the horses ran off but that pinto you're riding hung around.
i expect.
i hate to see any man swing. bad luck.
no hard feelings.
you might make a farmer yet.
that's a lie.
believe it.
j.t.'s done everything he can. i married a brave man. augie take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking. mckendrick picked the new sheriff himself so j.t. can't even get the law enforced.
it was not it was murdo's. those mckendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
i can't say i'm convinced you're going anywhere.
didn't he tell you about blind pete.
i'm not sure but i got an idea. and when i am sure they're going to pay.
why him.
it's been a while.
let's talk about that. i'm looking for some men.
it is that.
i'm a great believer in doing nothing.
so we understand each other.
you wouldn't be needing any help around here would you. maybe with the gambling.
i don't own this place. the man who does stuck me with kelly.
some people think because they're stronger or meaner they can push you around. i've seen a lot of that. but it's only true if you let it be. the world is what you make of it.
it's an advance. we want him to know he's going to be happy here.
i want to reassure you elaine there's absolutely nothing going on between viktor and i.
i'm glad we talked.
not just any mike & ike's cherry mike & ike's. do you know why i viktor taransky two-time academy award nominated director 
you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in.
listen viktor i have good memories of those days too but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal. this is business.
spare me.
where is she.
i can't wait to meet her.
as i've tried to explain to you elaine. simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. she's about the work and only the work lives for the work. she wants all the money up there  on the screen where it belongs. she'd work for scale except i know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
which accounts for your percentage. when do i get to meet this dream.
soon. soon.
everyone you know is lying.
 you can't go in there.
no of course not. why. would you care if we were.
i would rather have you than simone. believe me.
i know it as surely as you're sitting here sweetheart. she was the most vital woman i ever met.
you understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the er  scent.
no i'm okay.
hello hal.
and still the connection was undeniable. i haven't read eternity forever but i know it's brilliant. and i know i would be perfect for clive.
you can't.
you do.
listen hank it's been a rough day. i'll call you about his next week.
she's at the premiere of a cold day in hell. but i think she send someone from acquisitions.
so that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six.
dad you know i don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now. she broke up with kent.
i know but mom doesn't. maybe if it came from simone if simone spoke to mom she could straighten things out. dinner maybe.
dinner. dinner's difficult. a phone call.
 no. i can't go along with this horseshit. just tell them they can fry me.
don't you have a real story to write. why aren't you in latin america.
she sounds like a prisoner taransky. are you holding her hostage. are you some kind of svengali.
i'm just trying to help you sayer. i don't want you to be disappointed. it gets cold out here at night.
nice try. if we can't get to her through you maybe your family will be more co-operative. i can guarantee you taransky one way or another miss simone and i are going to get acquainted.
it's bogus. you used an old library shot for the background.
what is it exactly you want sayer.
mr. sayer did we pay the million bucks yet.
i don't understand.
you'd cosmetically alter simone to look like me.
what if it catches on fire.
simone are you there.
good morning simone.
mr. taransky we both know i was nothing without you. i was computer code ones and zeros.
see beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. see that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  see that if the performance is genuine it doesn't matter if the actor is real. once a performance is committed to film the blood and bones are gone anyway. only the spirit the illusion remains. besides what's real anymore. these days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
you know that's probably not the best idea. i'll just wait to see them in the store.
no.
you want to ask me a question.
i don't know how the story ends. i hope it's a happy ending.
how often do you see them.
i told you what i want.
something happened didn't it.
no we're not.
what.
someone got hurt.
dead people.
i don't know.
what.
cole please stop.
like what.
it's our pleasure.
i work at an insurance place and at penny's so cole can go to that good school.
you ever hear of the harvest of blood.
could take a little while though.
where'd you come from. groupies r us.
fuck you.
aha. the lovers.
yeah. it's the alternator all right.
there's something weird going on here suzie.
aaaaaaaaaaaa 
you're not going to arrest me for it are you.
peggy-sue 
well there goes our record deal.
you're out of your mind man.
the ancient aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
so what does it do.
and a slash-slash there 
carl. oh carrrrl.
you'll be back.
then who. because someone wants another blood harvest. with human blood jeremiah. just like jethro. who did he kill back then jeremiah. farmhands. transients. people no one would miss. crazy old macdonald. but now it's starting again isn't it. someone's picking up where jethro left off.
never heard of it.
yes.
strange i can feel my old self coming back
you sabotaged the bus. you kept us here to die. first keith then carl 
yeah. great work rod. but next time it would be nice if you could join us for the entire set.
 where have you two been.
bill you're chief of police now.
bill this brenda's randy flagg's niece. we need to find grant yesterday. the town council has lit a roman candle and stuck it up my ass.

when you wanted to run away i called your dad.
you took bill.
what.
rorschach.
sorry.
already ain't. married a gal named 
guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
maybe you better sit back down. you don't look so good.
aw ain't you glad to see me bandit.
i got a boy running in the peach tree classic tomorrow and when he wins i wanna celebrate in style.
they're both a challenge.
you have a great profile.
jesus

what are you gonna do when you get home.
i'm working bandit. besides what's the matter. won't your new girl friend help you.
i don't know man. ask him.
we gotta let the slack out cledus; this is costing us time.
that's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
anything else you don't want me to know.
now what.
we're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
what's that pardner.
when we agree to do a job we do it. right.
breaker. breaker.
so bill if i understand this right you currently have your penthouse floor under construction.
c'mon bill you've got some sultan up there one of your whales big- spender likes a lot of space you cook up this construction thing.
unreal this guys jacket too. wall- to-wall major felony offenses murder extortion arson grand larceny  a paternity suit i just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
i did. we yeah i know.
i forgive you darwin.
oh hell yeah. we's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. so don't feel so bad dude.
 forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest. buddy nobody knows about your condition or your drug use. why you lied to me knowing that i'd find out anyway i'll never know but it imperative now that i see you.
so i guess you're not going.
i am. yeah.
they what. what. no. no. why.
you think it's possible he could be involved in the israel hit.
what the hell what is this. people died. agent carruthers is dead.
 you can and you will.
you got clicks anything.
 he's doing it then huh 
yeah there's a pair'a broads i'm thinking might be good for this.
lil' cagey y'know don't like t'share trade secrets that type'a thing.
like a mafucka.
i feel like i know you girl. i feel like i've known you forever. you gonna lemme see your scars.
what were you doin' here anyway.
i ain't even goin' dignify that. you my road dog. we threw up sets. plus you stank.
i'm not givin' it up jus' yet
what's the time frame.
a puppet.
didn't you talk to snow.
who here could possibly care what you want. at best you're employee of the month for the highest bidder in the solaris auction. they have no idea what's going on up here. they've never even been in space. and i'm supposed to listen to you.
you murdered her.
you fucking bastard
gibarian warned me. he left me a message.
how long can you go without sleep.
and professionally.
she has materialized from your memory of her. what was her name.
stop equivocating. unbelievable how you equivocate. you the atheist you're more dogmatic than any holy person i've ever seen. this is happening kelvin. wake up.
well i think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here right. certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
human beings can die.
i want you to get sartorius to abandon his plan.
to calm your anxiety.
you behave as though you want to fuck her.
and i just want to know if i'm crazy or not if what i think is happening is actually happening. or am i one of those people those women who are blind to what's going on. who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman.
but what if solaris is what there was before the big bang.
i can't help feeling that i'm cheating when i take them.
you feel sorry for solaris or for me.
i have these strange thoughts i don't know where they come from. i can't explain it.
what's happening to us.
i'm not rheya. you've always known that.
you didn't like him.
you still writing the occasional magazine article.
straight ahead.
right. that's true.
i'm supposed to call in.
people think i'm stepping out on neil. we're causing quite a scandal.
i'll have a spritzer order something soft for yourself i must go for a pee.
they're kind of fuzzy.
that's the dumbest walk i ever saw.
no no seriously. there's a study done on this you walk this way the muggers are gonna single you out.

claire

mike.
hey. the neighbors.

what's this. a cockaroach.

just call me spidey.
even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
fill in the blank: i blank elizabeth allan.
i hate
no. i was lying about the coffee.
some prep school thing.
eugene. admit it peter you'd do anything for a nickname like flash.
i've gotta study.
no it wasn't only you it it just wasn't my style. hey look let's go to lunch. someplace nice for a change.
you'd feel what.
oh god i forgot to
you were the last one to see thorkel. in octavius' hospital room.
you sure about all this.
aunt may you're trespassing.
when i moved out you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle
proof. proof of a unified field. not just theory and equations experimental proof.
otto i don't like thorkel any more than you do. but he has got a point.
rosomoff i have better things to do than teach introductory physics to mindless adolescents.
all right we may be insignificant imperfect creatures but we're all we've got.
truth. truth alone exists. truth must be released
i asked if you felt like a drink
you're sure you're all right.
professor you ever fly one of these things before.
what's wrong with him.
you must have shot off your mouth all the way from frankfurt to here.
what's the match gag.
they ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
in this barracks.
come on trader horn. let's hear it: what'd you give the krauts for that egg.
my legs are frozen.
i'll live.
i didn't do it i didn't do it.
i didn't do it. i was in the frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
here we have a typical barrack. it houses seventy-five men. every one of them has his own bunk naturally.
well herr inspector. how did you find the camp. crowded but gemuetlich shall we say.
hey schulz. i got a deal for you. suppose you help us escape. we'll go home and have everything ready for you in madison square garden. for the world championship. schulz the beast of bavaria versus halitosis jones.
i don't care if they wear galoshes.
you want betty grable.
me. what if she don't want me.
don't you remember animal. a chicken lays those things.
so what. there's other women.
what do they always say.
so it is from the finance company. so it's better than no letter at all. so they want the third payment on the plymouth. so they want the fourth the fifth the sixth and the seventh. so they want the plymouth.
there joey ain't that better than being a lawyer.
you want to go.
no volunteers price. i said we're all in on it.
you must get out. for your own good you must get out.
if you can't get the bbc how about getting guy lombardo.
what's it add up to you sefton.
you starting that again.
what's the decoy.
just one little thing. how come you were so sure manfredi and johnson wouldn't get out of the forest.
so was the radio private property. so was manfredi and johnson.
thirty-fifth.
ach so.
what did you say.
i'll kill you for that.
which one of us is the informer.
schulz you're off your nut.
my grandmother's ear-muffs.
i thought he was the chief engineer.
but that wasn't so long ago. it couldn't have been more than
no sir. i am finding it difficult to concentrate. i believe i am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. it's something we all have to learn to deal with.
lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. where are the lifeforms-
data this isn't the time.
i believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
this is the nexus.
yes where would you go.
i don't understand.
oh
i'm not going scotty help me with this chute.
sulu. when did he find the time for a family.
the first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death. scotty.
kirk here.
you want me to contact starfleet.
captain are you all right.
it's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies. but it goes deeper than that doesn't it. i can sense that rene meant a great deal to you.
or perhaps they're on the surface.
nothing for me. i understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
the thought had crossed my mind.
it looks like we're too late.
an experimental compound the romulans have been working on. in theory a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. but they never found a way to stabilize it.
worf prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. we'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
tractor beam aye.
don't give me your klingon mumbo- jumbo there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
an energy reading from 'c deck from inside mr. spock's quarters
locate.
could it be spock's.
hello sir. it's david.
it's okay i should have known you'd come saavik's right: this planet is unstable. it's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
how can you be logical at a time like this. we have to get thee hell off this planet.
if equipment is functioning properly indications are an animal life form.
affirmative captain. our readings are well below danger level.
yes admiral. but that may not be possible.
yes yes spock
the ship out of danger.
sir planet core readings unstable changing rapidly
if i read this right sir we have full power.
welcome aboard admiral.
jim you are my best officer and if i had a best friend you'd be that too. but i am commander starfleet so i don't break rules.
i say again: grissom this is enterprise. admiral kirk calling captain esteban or lieutenant saavik. come in.
admiral your young friend is mistaken. i meant what i said. and now to show my intentions are sincere i am going to kill one of the prisoners.
beam the vulcan up and we talk.
give me what i want and i'll consider it

met his death. how could you his friend have assumed that. why did you leave him on genesis. spock trusted you and you denied him his future.
he asked you not to grieve
what i have done i had to do.
but surely our mission has not failed .
how is that.
commander these are some of the most famous people in starfleet. admiral kirk my god.
but it's damn irregular. no destination orders no encoded i.d
all true.
i am going to do nothing about it. <u>you</u> are going to sit in the closet.
but dear lord are we intelligent enough to suppose this thing were used where life already exists.
i don't dispute that in the wrong hands 
physician heal thyself.
bless me doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods.
but i'm allergic to retlax.
say thank you.
damn it jim what the hell's the matter. other people have birthdays. why're we treating yours like a funeral.
what do you want. damn it why isn't there a girl here. you know this has nothing to do with age. this is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping galaxies.
it never rains but when it pours 
repeat what's wrong. what's wrong.
wait 
thanks a lot. no respect from my offspring 
so are we it looks like.
this. it took the starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. what we did in there we did in a day. david why don't you show dr. mccoy and the lieutenant our idea of food.
we've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
how soon 
but good words. that's where ideas begin. maybe you should listen to them.
let go he can't .
give me some time to recall the data on our computers 
thirty seconds
aye sir.
scotty what's left.
she's not responding
mr. scott you old space dog. you're well.
midshipman you're a tiger.
give the word admiral.
the energizer's bypassed like a christmas tree so don't give me too many bumps.
engine room reports auxiliary power restored. we can proceed at impulse power.
kirk to enterprise. damage report spock.
they destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
regula i is a scientific research laboratory if memory serves
there are two possibilities sir they are unwilling to respond they are unable to respond.
you've got to learn why things work on a starship. it's coming through now khan
scanners and sensors still inoperative. there's no way to tell what's inside the station.
and no way of knowing if reliant is still in the area
i think we can guarantee she'll follow us mr. saavik. remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
transmission jammed at the source sir.
and why not.
yes.
indeterminate life signs.
all stop sir.
three minutes thirty seconds.
thank you sir. i've looked forward to this for a long time.
sir you did it.
approaching regula and space lab regula i.
very well mr. saavik clear all moorings.
fine. just fine.
bob it's tearing me apart.
i know. i feel the same thing. but we're between a rock and a hard place. we can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
not at all. you gave me things to think about. you always do. you do sound a little wrecked why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling.
that's crazy.
really. you think this is its way of saying hi there to the people of the earth.
you just said there aren't any except on earth of the past.
who are you. doctor adams was supposed to assist me.
like what.
the top of what.
shields mr. chekov.
neutralized. how.
lds. are you dyslexic on top of everything else. come on lemme give you a lift. i have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases that's why i work with whales.
then 
my whales. where could you take them where they'd be safe.
i bet you're a damn good poker player.
but kirk
ready to engage computer admiral.
what is our target in time.
availability of fuel components; mass of the vessel through a time continuum and the probable location of humpbacks in this case the pacific basin.
you've programmed that from memory.
as you observed a primitive culture.
well for one thing you haven't quite got the hang of it.
you've done it before. can't you remember.
the tank will be finished by morning
is that the logical thing to do spock.
aye sir. descending.
three-one-zero aye.
10 seconds sir.
then this is what it would sound like underwater.
any luck.
bearing 327 range 600 nautical.
not good enough scotty. you've got to do better.
stand by sir. miracle worker at work
mr. scott don't make jokes we are in danger of -
excelsior. why in god's name would you want that bucket of bolts.
even as the federation negotiated a peace treaty with us kirk was secretly developing the genesis torpedo. conceived by kirk's son and test detonated by the admiral himself. the result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called the genesis planet a secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the klingon people. we demand the extradition of kirk. we demand justice.
we deny nothing. we have the right to preserve our race.
professor scott if you'll 
they are my friends.
ojichan. akira ojichaan dewa naino. koko de nani shiteru no.
sulu hikaru.
ah sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira. ah then i am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
i know what a hologram is captain. the question is why would someone want to create one of our village.
we've always known that to survive we had to remain apart. it hasn't been easy. many of the young people here want to know more about the offland they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life
yes. exactly. nothing more complicated than perception. you explore the universe. we've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself full of powerful forces most people aren't aware enough of the now to ever notice them
won't he rust.
 i am the personification of everything they have rejected.
you're not going to launch anything until
you have no idea what precipitated his behavior.
how can there be an order to abandon the prime directive.
is this how a federation officer begs for his life.
the countdown control has been transferred to the collectori can't override
the injector performs perfectly in every simulation
there is an alternative to an all- out assault. isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
moving them is one thing. killing them all
we're about to lose communications with starfleet captain.
why would they fire at him without provocation.
full impulse.
what's inside that nebula cluster.
i i must have slept through my alarm. i'm on my way
we're coming as fast as we can we can't risk using phasers
he might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
direct hit. he's resetting his shield harmonics
the damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire.
the ba'ku could use some rest sir. according to the geo-scan this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers
one. it's ru'afo.
we've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the son'a.
but it's comfortable.
augh.
initiate launch sequence.
exactly as the simulations predicted
it's not the radiation and there's nothing wrong with the combadges the enterprise just isn't responding.
how did doctor almack react to that.
they're not your friends they've held you back kept you from your destiny
isn't it better like this.
vulcan.
it has entered earth orbit. correction it is not in orbit. it is heading directly toward the surface.
mister data i want to know the exact date and time. give me a damage report on that missile silo.
i am the borg.
where's the battery room for the hospital.
alphanumeric lock. we need a password to get in
ready to make a little history.
altitude fifty kilometers
they're getting awfully close what the hell are they doing.
lieutenant actually. lieutenant jonathan scrimm. i'm the head of the resurrection protective force. and you are.
it wasn't a trick. i used to be an electrical engineer.
something wrong with that.
no but sometimes i feel that way. what i meant was i'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
what.
you're not someone who lies very easily so it's obvious when you do at least to me.
we're trying to repair doctor cochrane's ship. it's been damaged and 
it's the future isn't it. just like you told scrimm. i knew you weren't from around here.
that's impossible.
target locked.
a ship-wide decompression has been initiated.
they're connecting the conduits to subspace communications
try not to look at the stars keep your eyes on the ship.
we've lost bridge control.
they're bypassing engineering
even data.
time we got underway ourselves gentlemen. once again we've saved civilization as we know it.
we're explorers not diplomats.
doctor mccoy what is your current medical status.
it takes a lot of effort.
you were demoted
well i -
mr. spock rura penthe's deep in klingon territory. if we're discovered
we'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
he's got it.
fraid not. it wouldn't fit him anyway.
we don't get many presidential assassins.
thank you. lieutenant one quarter impulse power
i'm still in the chair lieutenant.
i gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment i don't think many on board are.
i hope you're happy.
there's an old vulcan proverb: only nixon could go to china.
i believe the captain feels that starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
what is it.
i'm going. you are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
what peace conference.
what's she waiting for.
the only way to find out if a man's trustworthy
channel open captain.
captain 
we surrender.
you have done well saavik. as your sponsor at the academy i have followed your career with satisfaction. and as a vulcan.
commander uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
we've been ordered to -
fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
i have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port 
it's as i said mr. spock: inventory still registers every torpedo.
a computer canna lie sir.
you are me.
do you know the name of the captain of this vessel.
no. can i move now.
for how long.
when was he created.
to seek out new life and new civilizations. zephyr. cochran’s own words. when charles darwin set out on the h.m.s. beagle on his journey into the unknown he sailed without a single musket.
that was another time.
and this makes you sad.
what do you imagine this is.
ready captain.
sir allow me to go. you are needed here.
you have a red shirt.
why.
the least i could do for you deanna. besides you know me i’m a talking head.
imzadi. this is so good.
he can never know you as i know you he can never touch you as i touch you.

i read six distinct positronic signatures spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. but he's got it captain.
how long until he can fire.
admiral janeway. good to see you.
believe me we don't under- stand it either. you're the closest ship so i want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. get the lay of the land if the empire becomes unstable it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
it would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
captain i hope i don't have to remind you 
sir 
it's an old psychological strategy number one. to put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
yes. the eyes have it.
our eyes reflect our lives don't they. yours are so confident.
of course you do. if you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people you’d be sitting where i am now. at least i hope you would.
looking up at the stars.
you're not reman.
my life is meaningless as long as you're alive. what am i while you exist. a shadow. an enigma.
i'm incapable of such an act and so are you.
the man who is jean luc picard and shinzon of remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet. he is better than that.
are we prepared.
praetor. you have the whole fleet at your disposal. they supported the coup they'll follow you.

sure.
i'll take that.
i understand.
hey that sounds interesting. you like it.
i'm going to the white house right now. i'll try and get you everything you need.
then it's not an accident that they found us.
george we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
we don't know what else to do. we need results.
hello george.
you can change a directive george. you've done it before. listen to me. he's going somewhere in death valley. lathrop wells was never anything but a bus stop. east is the nuclear site. there are no roads in there. she was teaching him to hitchhike. i'm telling you. we block the four roads into death valley and we got him.
then you're going to have to do it without me.
mrs. haydn
this is george fox
what.
money.
it was yellow.
why are you going here. what is here.
sun
a baby is a new person.
why.
'salt lake city please. i do not speak english.'
jennyhaydn.
no. my ship was doing a map of all the suns and
a friend is a person that is good to you someone you like to be with someone you like to laugh with
the police shouldn't have started shooting. but you can hardly blame them. you surprised them. they didn't know you were up there. when they saw you they thought you were here to hurt us.
what are you doing.
nobody knows.
i've noticed do you understand what they're saying.
that was beautiful.
on the radio they say it's good.
you promised.
good morning.
here are two quarters. when you lose these you're not going to get anymore.
i know how to gamble now.
you want the baby to laugh at me.
how long will it take you to get home.
i love you.
you have no conception of this do you.
there's nothing no reports of sightings or landings or anything in the other parts of the country or overseas seems like a totally isolated incident.
okay let's get you wired up. i hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
superconducting quantum interference device. squid. got it. there's gonna be a test.
lenny the loser. panhandler of stolen dreams.
believe it. now bring me the trodes baby. come on quick.
you were supposed to go downstairs baby.
that's a good one coming from you.
maybe.
look baby i've watched you create yourself out of nothing. you're like a goddamn cruise missile targeted on making it. and you will.
can't do it.
don't know. but this guy's real damaged goods. iris knew someone was after her and she said you were in danger too. now no more games faith. whatever you're hiding whatever's going on you have to get out of here now. come with me right now. don't even think about it.
yeah. no not really.
come on lenny. you used to be good at this stuff. play it down. what's the perp doing.
and he records it. thrill kill. wants to see it again. and again.
faith ok.
whattya mean.
jesus.
he's got her up in the room under guard. and he's still working the party acting smooth like nothin's nothin'. so buddy i say we work a trade.
picture it i feel like i gotta share this with somebody. it's too perfect.
tick. not to dash your hopes but i don't deal this kind of product you know that. i'll give you four for it cause i've gotta cut off the last bit. and my customers want uncut.
fuck that. the last part's the best. you dry-dive six stories and blammo. jack right into the big black.
i don't deal black-jack clips. it's policy. i got ethics here.
yeah she came by last night. shaking like a junkie wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
i always do.
what the fuck are you doing.
i need my case. it's still in the back.
i've had it. no more wirehead shit in my car. you understand. you want to poach your lobes do it somewhere else.
lenny you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life. you're always broke you just go from one score to the next. and you're getting strung out you don't even see it. getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
she said if they get me. they. which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
so the guy's not a sicko.
because it had to look random. not connected to anything or anyone. but then why give the rape to me.
you better keep a low profile for a while.
we're going to aunt cecile's honey. we're going to watch fireworks from there. let's go. chop chop.
fine. do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains. the gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground. and when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves. it'll be all- out war and you know it.
was this him.
pacific northwest is a hotbed for serials.
no sir.
oh jesus sheriff i am sorry. i meant to call you i got distracted the sumpter girl was not one of speck's victims. that's the good news.
what does the manager say.
tape it off we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. my guess is that the unsub is having us on. he checks in pays picks up the key but never walks inside. tell me if i'm wrong.
what.
what did he look like.
there was a car in the lot when we closed. gone today.
what are you doing.
let some by-the-book j. edgar agents go into the chat room spook these guys with stupid questions blow my cover. no way.
this time sir if i may be so bold would it be possible to set up my equipment outside ciiac perhaps in military housing at quantico. i didn't get along very well with the other members of the division. we thought differently.
that gasbag. i can imagine what he said. i'm not ashamed to admit that most of what i know about criminal profiling started with richard low. i have also over the years i admit taken credit for many of his accomplishments. he was the most brilliant law enforcement individual i ever met.
they sort of got me on shit detail no offense.
i was interested in two things: computers and crime. they sort of came together.
i was thinking maybe we should ask professor daitz. nobody knows this stuff better.
i saw him on a talk show once talking about these killers like they were his friends. not the victims not the families of the victims he doesn't talk about them. blood money that's what it is. did he hit on you.
you mean 
no jaime i apologize. i didn't i had no right to speak to you like that.
no i mean maybe we should back off a bit you and me.
and nobody else can do that.
but why this pattern.
it's quite advanced.
low calls him suspect zero.
agent
how did you know speck was a killer.
i'm not sure exactly. i had monsters on the brain. i wanted to get these guys every one of them. i got obsessive.
suspect zero.
deputy director koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope risking high-profile failure. better to get rid of me. then he could be mr. serial killer mr. authority on deviant behavior no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one richard low. do you really think that plane crashed by accident. do you really think i wasn't on it by accident. i've always had a good sense of intuition.
hum a tune and i'll sing to it.
after my hiatus after i got my priorities readjusted i drifted online started tracking porn chat rooms looking for zero. got accepted came across these boys swapping stories pictures downloads. never found zero but i did come across some class a scumbags.
there's someone out there mack i know some man killing for the fun of it sniffing human glue without regard to age or sex without predicable m.o. someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. you have access you can call up local authorities check morgues conduct interviews. be my man.
i know you lionheart. i watched your mind work heard your dirty thoughts 
[reality very risky.]
[the address is 147 south rane. it's a lively address. you got a problem with dark meat.]
updating the condition of all bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector sir.
mydick.
do you realize that i've been waiting for that call for six months and i cut her off.
what do you drive.
you're a comedian.
nikki.
i thought i was going to die.
well it still sucks but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
he's so sweet. he really said that.
wait here i'll get you that martini.
do you ever perform out here. i'd love to see you.
you should. a lot of comics play vegas.
i know but she did. she's with someone else now
sorry it's just that
when i lived in new york they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. i got off the plane in l.a. six months ago and all i got to show for it is a tan.
you didn't have to get off the other line. i would've called you back.
hi lorraine. thanks for holding on.
what kind of things.
why didn't you call.
so the only difference is if i forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
i mean first you'll pretend not to care not call whatever and then eventually you really won't care.
it's a gig.
you're an actor. find the zen in the role.
haven't you noticed i didn't mention michelle once today.
it's like every day i see a beautiful woman. i'm not used to that. i'm used to seeing a beautiful woman i don't know once a week. i can't handle it.
i can't wait till i actually get to touch one of them.
there are so many beautiful women here.
it's unbelievable.
well you're doing so well
at least you didn't get turned down for goofy
because you left man. she's got her own world to deal with in new york. she was a sweet girl but fuck her. you gotta move on. you gotta let go of the past. the future is so beautiful. every day is so sunny out here. it's like manifest destiny man. i mean we made it. what's past is prologue. that which does not kill us makes us stronger. all that shit. you'll get over it.
pause it.
who threw this party anyway.
big butt you know can't fly coach.
you live in such a fantasy world
what vegas.
tonight baby.
i'll pick you up in a half an hour.
wake up baby.
this place is dead. i thought this was the city that never sleeps.
don't make fun i think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
twenty but i was down at least fifty. i'm sorry i got hot at the crap table.
you won. there's nothing to be sorry about. you're a winner. i'm the fuckin loser. i should be sorry.
mikey's the big winner.
you think so.
what was the part.
i don't know. the whole judy garland thing kind of turned me on. does that makes me some kind of fag.
yeah a good friend.
i just need some time
how long do i wait to call.
bitch you little bitch.
because he's a bitch.
i don't know. i guess kids were hitting each other or something.
is he cute. ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail.
no.
laugh all you want but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
shut up sue
i know for a fact you haven't because you never shut up about it. you're like a little whiney bitch
what do you want of me. i'll give you anything you want but do what i ask.
what was that.
eat it it's on the table.
my business is heroin i have poppy fields laboratories in narseilles and sicily ready to go into production. my importing methods are as safe as these things can be about five per cent loss. the risk is nothing the profits enormous.
what percentages for my family.
are you worried about security for your million.
i kept trying to call you after my divorce and tom always said you were busy. when i got the wedding invitation i knew you weren't sore at me anymore godfather.
you take care of your family.
when did he call.
mention it don't insist. barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
i told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
barzini will move against you first.
yes.
don tommassino.
what is it.
only the son of a pezzonovanta.
if luca sold out we're in real trouble.
the other families won't sit still for all out war.
and when they shot me father
i found out about this captain mccluskey who broke mike's jaw. he's definitely on sollozzo's payroll and for big money. mccluskey's agreed to be the turk's bodyguard. what you have to understand is that while sollozzo is guarded like this he's invulnerable. nobody has ever gunned down a new york police captain. never. it would be disastrous. all the five families would come after you sonny; the corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover. so justtake that into consideration.
one of tattaglia's people.
pop they hit us and we hit them back.
will you give this letter to michael.
what about mccluskey.
bookkeepers know everything. rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing. they get a little more money than the job's worth. lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
i've never seen anything like it.
then luca turned to the other man
i told you you wouldn't like him.
if he's your brother why does he have a different name.
i used to come down to new york whenever he sang at the capitol and scream my head off.
can you say it.
visiting hour ends at eight thirty. i'll just sit with him; i want to show respect.
don't you want dinner first.
how can you be sure.
is it going to be all-out war like last time.
sollozzo is a dead man i don't care what it costs. i don't care if we have to fight all the five families in new york. the tattaglia family's going to eat dirt. i don't care if we all go down together.
a million times.
do you renounce satan.
no. i want things very calm for another six months.
barzini wants to arrange a meeting. says we can straighten any of our problems out.
did you forget where i live. it's four o'clock.
we.
is that good.
it's vile.
no i like him.
well i knew you so i suppose you must have known me.
i could fuck this icebox i love it so much. what were you actually doing in new york.
a few places that's a few jobs. anyway i don't want to think about new york.
do you have any brothers.
relax. the most important question is where to eat. i hope freddie made a reservation.
freddie.
what's the fight about. that's her fiancee isn't it. are they blaming him.
i'm prepared to take the blame.
marge and i are getting married.
i love marge.
i don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. if you said he was still at lunch i'd believe you. incredible. the guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
what about christmas.
what. i think i'm saying it. something's going on. he's either converted to christianity or to something else.
tom. how are you. you look well.
i could probably see my bedroom from here. i can see my house. when you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream isn't it.
hello tom. you're off. what are your plans.
are you okay.
he hates being confronted.
marge how are you. what are you doing in rome.
marge you know dickie has i hate opera tattooed on his chest.
tell me the truth. did he kill freddie.
dickie did it.
i was looking forward to seeing him.
very.
did dickie's dad go.
marge. where are you going.
today for the first time i've even wondered whether he might have killed freddie. he would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him well you know that. marge. i loved you you might as well know i loved you and because he knew i loved you he let you think i loved him. didn't you see couldn't you see. i don't know maybe it's grotesque to say this now so just write it on a piece of paper or something and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. tom loves me.
i hope so.
at christmas. to cortina with freddie miles and 
c'mon i need to talk to you. just the two of us.
don't worry. really. don't worry.
oh meredith i'm sorry. of course i'll meet you. let's have coffee in the morning at dinelli's.
i don't is that by the spanish steps.
i was looking at you your clothes i wouldn't have known you
just kidding. are you alone.
and co. a lot of co. oh god i've thought about you so much.
i haven't been hiding. i've been in police custody. they've been trying to flush out freddie's killer.
dove e stato il signor ripley da allora.
ten thirty.
what do you mean. they're sending someone from rome.
he's already angry i don't think 
i'm sorry. i was asleep. i must have fallen asleep.
good. but i think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
didn't look that way you know from a distance.
dickie and peter that's just too good gossip isn't it.
what are you talking about you're not a nobody. that's the last thing you are.
good things about tom ripley. could take some time. tom is talented. tom is tender tom is beautiful
yes.
senta. we have to ask you to stay in rome.
never. we've had many requests and of course we say no even to your fiancée.
i don't remember the exact date.
i have.
good. the goldoni. yes you're right. a coincidence. i look forward to our next meeting when i will be more careful with my english and persuade you to play me your saxophone. alto.

how much for everything.
you in nam. can't help but notice your jacket.
yeah. i was all around. one hospital then the next.
yes.
i can believe that.
three in the morning. i don't think so. i have to go to bed early. i work days. it must have been somebody else.
what hours do you work.
travis you haven't even played the record.
yeah well my stereo player is broke. but i'm sure the record is ok.
where are you going.
this is sort of high class
well mostly
huh.
more people watch it.
that taxi driver. the one that's been sitting here.
first she did her make-up. you know i hate it when they do that. i mean she does the whole works the mascara the eye-shadow the lipstick the rouge
well whatever the fuck it is she used it. and then the spray perfume. you know the real sweat kind and on top of that get this right when we're crossing the tri-boro bridge she changes her pantyhose.

travis what single thing would you want the next president of this country to do most.

surprise surprise.
come on delly look at the country today. we're fighting communists in korea we're paranoid about the russians we've got this thing with the rosenbergs and the atomic bomb you think they want suspected communists entertaining the american public with party propaganda like gosh i don't know sand pirates of the sahara.
no i i just wondering where you've been all this time.
me too.
you can all go home now. he's not going anywhere.
city hall.

mr. chairman there's another amendment that i'd like to invoke at this time but it's not the fifth amendment. i wonder if you're familiar with it.
what's that.
or the bijou. either one.
good to meet you. again.
i can only imagine. you know i spoke with your dad last year about maybe taking the bijou off his hands. i don't think he gave it very much thought.
so you do intend to fix the place up after all.
well after the war with so many of the town's boys killed people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies i guess. some of 'em moved away los angeles sacramento san francisco. wasn't much to keep 'em here i expect. and now with this television thing people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
february 10 1942. picture 'ball of fire.'

are you saying it's a mistake that you didn't go to any meetings. they say you did.
they don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them. they just don't want you writing pictures for now. that's all.
peter i believe in you. more to the point i read your new script um

thank you. it gives me something to do with my spare time. there's a lot of spare time in bodega bay. did you plan on staying long.
yes.
oh hi. did you find her all right.
it's utilitarian i'll say that for it.
i just picked up some things for the night at the general store. you see i hadn't planned on spending much time here.
hi. is something wrong. is that cut beginning to bother you.
how do you like our little hamlet.
what do you mean.
then why did she object to you.
afraid i'd give mitch.
then what are you doing here in bodega bay.
you get straight to the point don't you.
and the second.
yes.
is anyone there.
mitch knows lots of people in san francisco. of course they're mostly hoods.
they haven't harmed anyone.
oh i suppose so.
could i have a puff.
she said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back east.
oh. where d'you want the coffee.
why are they trying to kill people.
good morning.
i didn't want to come right down the road where they could see me.
mmmmmm. 'course you could get yourself a boat cut right across the bay with it. the brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. if that's what you wanted to do.
the little girl's name.
the little brenner girl.
near the top of the hill you'll see the school and right behind it the church. you head for the school. now just past the school you'll see a little house with a red mail box. that's where annie hayworth lives she's the school teacher. you ask her about the little brenner girl.
i don't see what difference it makes mrs. bundy crows or blackbirds. if they attacked the school that's pretty serious.
we don't have any fog this time of year mitch.
how do you do miss daniels. acknowledge a what.
lovebirds i see.
whose side are you on.
i think i can handle melanie daniels by myself.
well well is everyone all right.
i'm not very good at this mitch.
where can we go mitch. there's no place to go.
if if when we get to san francisco if they're already there.
they won't be.
al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm.
he was calling from the farm mrs. brenner.
yes i'm sure she's fine.
why mrs. brenner.
would you. i'd feel so much better.
didn't know how he got in there. had a broken leg turned out. just fluttering all around there.
bodega bay. he goes up there every weekend.
sixty oh.
about an hour and a half on the freeway. or two if you take the coast highway.
i'd hold the birds for him but i'm going away myself. someone's got to feed them i suppose.
lovebirds sir.
no sir those are redbirds.
oh certainly. it's to protect the species.
ahhh but i know you.
how.
we never met in court or anyplace else.
and i'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds.
so you're a lawyer.
ouch.
yes.
just a few just a day or two the weekend.
oh no you don't.
i don't know. but it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who i was and where i lived and
i loathe you. you have no manners. and you're arrogant and conceited and i wrote you a letter about it in fact but i tore it up.
i was. and all i get for my pains is a a a hole in the head.
certainly but
you'll be able to find your way back won't you.
i'm in san francisco five days a week. with a lot of time on my hands. i'd like to see you. maybe we could go swimming or something. mother tells me you like to swim.
you were just a poor innocent victim of circumstance huh.
i'm neither poor nor innocent but the truth of that particular
yes but
and you didn't come up here to see her.
did you really write a letter to me. or was that a lie too.
what did it say.
i told you what happened in rome.
i'd still like to see you.
what do you want .
on thursdays i have my meeting and lunch. i'm chairman of a group that's sending a little korean boy through school. we plan how to raise funds and things like that.
it's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday isn't it. it's so beautiful and still now. i think i've got it all figured out by the way.
growing a beard
hear hear.
what do you mean.
you'd have been safe in san francisco.
have you got a pencil.
yes certainly.
immediately. is this the daily news. melanie daniels. would you get me the city desk please.
i don't know why.
sebastian i'm not an alarmist.
no. i don't mitch. because i can't see any reason for it.
then help me sebastian. you're an important man in this town. if you'll help the rest will.
i'm not sure but
they made some mess too smashing into houses and everything. they always make a mess. we're better off without them.
how many gulls did you count mrs. bundy.
the ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
i haven't finished my drink.
i'm very pleased to know you master fettes.
you must leave this house.
i can't do that you heard macfarlane.
he's not home.
there's no standing between a fool and his folly. if you must babble your news to him he's at the fisherman's tryst. it's the inn at pennycuik. you can use macfarlane's horse and gig to get there. he'll welcome the ride back.
you see it is completely out of the question.
well 
but i didn't ask him to kill.
when she's ready you bring her to me i'll show her how.
i know it i know it the moment i was rid of him 
this is not a woman.
what you really want to ask me is about my back isn't it about where it hurts.
they're uncommon bold the grave robbers and the daft doctors who drive them on.
it might be an interesting case.
now that wasn't a friendly thing i heard toddy. not at all friendly.
you can't build life like you put together blocks toddy.
i'll tell you what toddy. it's because i ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. it's because you were afraid to face it and you're still afraid.
well then i beg you i beseech you 
but why gray. why.
i want to speak to you alone. i saw something. i heard.
you're welcome to my little nest joseph is it not. that's right you have something to say to me something very private.
only brother.
you say you've come here on your own account. no one knows you are here.
but where did they get those people.
there's nothing i can say for one small child.
you're wrong.
you think i'm crazy.
you killed her. i saw it.
you're him. you're corvis. we fried your ass. you're dead man.
the scar.
are you out of your fucking mind. we're going to die.
how can you die if you're already dead.
i was a friend of your sister's.
he didn't kill her.
this tree. here's where it happened.
doubt is a motherfucker.
do you believe in ghosts nathan. because there's a ghost threatening us.
erin. i know you think she's been talking to you.
no.
that was my first question.
yes that is true.
in the hands of a mature civilization these would not be considered weapons of aggression. but in the hands of your people we've observed your aggressive tendencies and we don't trust you with such power.
it is not enough to have men of science. we scientists are too easily ignored or misunderstood. we must get important men from every field. educators philosophers church leaders men of vision and imagination the finest minds in the world.
my name is carpenter and i'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
maybe a little demonstration.
hi mom.
we sure had fun today. we saw the space ship and we went to see professor barnhardt and
yeah sure. mom do i have to go to school tomorrow.
of course dear.
no. it's for a lot of other things too.
you think it can go faster than an f- 36.
all right.
let's not say anything to my mother about this mr. carpenter.
all you have to remember is first find the common denominator then subtract.
oh i'd say forty-five.
just klaatu.
i mean the reasons for my coming here.
i am not concerned mr. harley with the internal affairs of your planet. i consider that to be your business not mine.
i was only hoping to make you understand.
we're all set. i picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. and the radio's still busted so me can forget about the space man for today.
well we could
are you crazy. after what happened today.
what happened.
i'm worried about gort. i'm afraid of what he might do if anything should happen to me.
he'll catch on to it in no time now.
oh i see. he was having trouble and you were helping him out.
yeah.
we don't ride with vampires.
okay. where's nosferatu.
should i run him through.
they're looking at us.
i'm my own man.
are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something.
of course not.
i don't want names. just lead me to him. where's their nest.
lucy you're the only woman i ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
max. you men we're having company again.
you like michael.
wait a minute kiddo.
i guess no one cares what i got a job.
what's wrong. tell me.
do you mind. it was a real scary comic.
these are my dinner guests. edgar and alan. the frog brothers.
but i don't think it's what you really want to do is it.
i guess if i had my choice i'd like to do something that involves children. work with kids in some way. teenagers maybe. and santa carla seems to be full of them.
you're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
i'm really sorry max.
star.
oh. your folks too huh.
i guess you're new around here.
have to sleep. have to sleep michael.
i have to talk to you. can i come up.
it's not too late for you to be saved but each night it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing
this is kind of a cool place.
grandpa does not own a t.v. have you noticed. there's no t.v. santa carla has no malls no cineplexes and now i won't even have mtv. i will not know anything hip happening anymore.
i was here first.
nowhere.
i told you it was pretty weird chinese food.
i'm making you a sandwich.
sixteen.
pretty nasty out mac. thirty-five knots.
don't you understand. that thing didn't want to become a dog
nobody's getting in here. you can tell them all that.
how you doin' old boy.
auxiliary light cables. been cut.
somebody broke in.
i suppose well it's possible someone might have lifted it from me. but
i said where. where'd you go.
somebody's taken it. i can't find it.
torch them.
you ain't tying me up.
then i'll have to kill you.
maybe we should try and fix the radio try and get some help.
now hold him.
nothing we can do about that.
hold on damn it. we're getting nowhere if this bit of blair's about absorbing and imitating is true then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
can there be some kind of test. to find out who's what.
i don't see how when i'm finished i return it right away.
right. why not.
that thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes macready.
what is it.
 made sure i got ahead of him on the towline on the way back cut him loose.
you know of them.
i was lucky. the others weren't.
as slaves.
how.
what.
say i just come back again.
a man can change his history.
god could have killed me bad girl nell. how did you know to do that.
ahhh i'm afraid i've got a prior commitment.
well there's something new.
darling.
let's walk through the park
damned if i can keep her out of my equations.
for god's sake david 
this was my home.
couldn't help but overhearing. two fine young people starting out on the road of life. i wish you the very best.
i'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
and there's no shame to that. it's all the same here. everyone has an important job to do. we all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
 it was a great city. the greatest city in the world.
learning was important.
it sounds like a wonderful place to live.
alexander.
you've welcomed me into your home. into your lives. everyone has for the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much. i thank you for that.
yes i suppose so.
don't torture me do you have it.
oh i'm already swooning.
as i recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is applied mathematics and engineering am i correct.
well perhaps i have deviated the tiniest bit.
i am the oldest.
where do they take them.
we'll see about that.
they're here. they're inside the house .
you ok.
then don't.
should we be
[beat] you don't believe me do you.
in where.
how did you come to know their names.
i don't understand
did you know my father.
we're late.
it's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
and i can't stay here in my condition. i am going to die tonight. it's already been decided.
but i like it i guess.
[beat] you bled to death.
[softly] i want to trust you. should i trust you.
i never knew my father. did you.
yeah i did. [beat] he was my most memorable patient.
so maybe dr. becker would know. [beat] but as i'm sure you know the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
and how do you know that.
you told me this was how it happened.
that's kingsley. old bastard hears us i'm sure. he just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. i know. i tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. literally. [beat] you're the cop killer right.
it's gonna be sticky.
geez how's that for a fucking thank you.
mackenzie [beat] what if we are crazy.
why of course.
yup. that's me.
[beat] why.
so you never knew your mother.
yeah me too. [softly] every day for the last ten years.
uh-huh.
well you're not exactly an expert witness but what makes you so sure.
hey.
why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
this is serious son. a man is dead.
it's just not working like this. we gotta do something. it'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals but jesus hal this is makin' us look bad. i don't know maybe they're not movin'. maybe that little creep lied.
what for.
i guess i'm startin' to feel a little better.
don't. i'm married. i don't feel good. i've been sick.
naw honey that would be burglary. i never got arrested for burglary. burglary's for chicken shits. if you're gonna rob someone ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it. just take the money. that's robbery. that's a whole 'nother deal.
ask me no questions i'll tell you no lies.
christ sure yes.
what.
so whaddya think. i mean i could uh get a job. of some kind. i mean you've been tellin' me that for years right.
don't worry darlin'. i'll say i never found you. i'll say anything you want. we'll find a way to get you out of this whatever it is.
damn jimmy did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff.
we don't need the lantern. the place has electricity.
it's bob's the day manager's. he's gettin' a divorce so his wife's gettin' this place so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
another hour of so. we've got enough food for a month.
all of it. that he tried to rape me.
if you weren't so concerned with having a good time we wouldn't be here right now.
louise this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride and i thought since
i know louise but we're running for our lives. don't you think you could make an exception just this once. i mean look at the map. the only thing between oklahoma and mexico is texas.
louise and darryl don't get along.
well boy he's got his work cut out for him now don't he.
well i'm not on drugs. but i might be crazy.
don't worry about it. you want anything.
oooooweee. you shoulda seen me. like i'd been doin' it all my life. nobody would ever believe it.
just past boise city.
now what what.
oh i don't know thelma. i guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on saturdays. maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
gosh. it sure is.
i am really sorry about this.
i know it's crazy louise but i just feel like i've got a knack for this shit.
yes thelma.
what do you mean.
no thelma. i'm not gonna make any deals.
but i don't know something's crossed over in me and i can't go back. i mean i just couldn't live
sure you know how to hotwire a car.
we can change our names.
yes. yes. now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that.

jeez i don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
it means you're too hard on guys.
what.
don't get all gooey on me now you'll give me a big head. the important thing doctor is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.

who gives a shit about the midterms now. the soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
they're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. we can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. we need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
all right so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. okay. you happy. so now what.
yes it is.
 i have the authority. i am the commander-in-chief of the united states and i say when we go to war.

i keep thinking if we were but half serious about money we should quit being hired hands and
why.
well <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash. you're the one's gotta have a plan.
in the past year i must've said a hundred times we gotta get out of perfection. we gotta better ourselves. you gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think i'm the reason we're still here. you want to know how close i am to going to bixby right <u>now</u>.
we did it. we faced temptation and we did not bend.
those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road. hey. where are you guys. people gotta use this road you know. you on a booze break or what.
pham we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners. they better be fast.

come on. get away from it.
darn it.
what's it doing.
yeah they're confused. they can feel our vibrations but they can't find us.
our own colombian connection for three years three years of ball breaking detective work. and we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
or this is this a significant difference.
look i'm a lawyer and 
what everything. you shot a corpse. i don't give a shit about that .
when did you start working for the goddam d.a.
 listen: november 5 1980. cecil stipe walked into 5th precinct. says he witnessed chin shooting saw suspect's picture in post. says shu kai kim wrong man.
what the lunatic who 
so what're we gonna do.
i've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. it's an even ten who say shu's gun killed jimmy chin.
but roeder's dead. ballistics says it's shu. we don't have one witness unless we put cecil stipe on the stand
 what.
how long did it take badalato to drive jimmy chin's body from chinatown to the morgue.
i haven't thanked you for your work kitty. you're doing good work.
want to tell me what went down here.
maybe because someone's afraid.
how can i tell you what i don't know.
when the d.a. hears i filed the writ he'll send someone here maybe claiming to be a journalist. that person will ask you lots of questions. just be truthful cecil okay. to all of us.
y-yes sir.
did the police make any attempt to phone you to follow up.
edward t. dowd.
this and that.
my staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers i said that can't be the same edward dowd.
i'm sorry if i've ruined your day mr. reynard. but my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and 
back in the seventies i spent years putting away gangsters in a colombian syndicate called the ochoa. these guys are very dangerous ed. when i hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys i see red.
now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side or you want to walk into any restaurant in chinatown and get free dumplings
are you implying that my motives are less than sincere.
i never joke about waiving a client's sixth amendment right to trial.
to the best of your recollection were you sober when you performed the tests.
my skip-trace turned up two cecil stipes. one's in butte montana. other's at riverhead veterans psychiatric.
i'll take odds on cecil number two.
and its purpose.
do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade.
yeah we do some of that.
i think what eddie wants to say is 
let's test it for the record. will the next victim be a man or a woman.
baby laxative. we can't snort baby laxative.
no shit we killed a guy for baby laxative.

the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. it wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
no one could find those splinters without a machine like this. and no one had a machine like this.
yes it is good. what do you think is in these other drawers.
crushed skull. probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
accidental.
geez agent desmond it's three-thirty in the morning. where are we going to sleep.
we're not. you and i are going to get some food.

my guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
no. i don't need to take this to be your friend.
all my things have me in them. i don't want you to be like me.

fish eyes.

i'm not saying it's right or wrong it's just the way i feel. it's the custom thing i was thinking of. in america we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. we throw away the tail the rest of the insides and the head.

maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
the rockies. you'd rather get back to that big family of yours in minnesota wouldn't you.
we will sir.
that probably dropped half way to pomona.what do you think.
chase you'd better come home.
what. what kind of episode.
is he all right.
dylan. he's holding well. earlier he had some problems he's in an oxygen tent just now
it was an earthquake and it was dark. i have no idea.
no way he's going anywhere. he's been well sedated.
he doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
yes. it's a story. a story for a movie.
i know what he's doing is bizarre but most of the time he seems so normal so well adjusted. i just can't believe it's him. i mean and not something outside influencing him. or is that how denial works.
thinking i saw freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy. and jumping in
i've never mentioned it to him.
i know how chase really died.
i'm sorry i can't.
listen dammit.
no i don't think that at all. how is he.
that was nancy not me.
dylan. and chase. my god wes did you know.
i don't know if it has really. with the exception of one and three i've pretty much kept out of it. i'm working in television now. the hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
sounds good. kim would you get heather and me a coffee. how you like it hon.
she said none the better you all go to hell
what do you mean.
fine.
albatross.
rick march. who the hell are you.
gieg chuck.
that's what they get for not locking the door.
it's a ninety-one. it's an 'a'.
you know i never had friends like this.
you gonna jump. or are you just having a last look.
they don't know that. we were the only one's on deck. look there's nothing they can do to me right. i'm a kid.
depths of hell ohio. how 'bout you.
yes sir.
so is violating international law.
albatross. doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
well we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
humor me. eat it anyway.
spying.
that's enough.
jesus. what the hell happened to him.
i couldn't do it.
this isn't just a story. it's history made allegory. it is a philosophical handbook for life. it holds the secret of this very voyage.
well that was neighborly.
what do you think.
if he's a cuban castro wears a dress.
you've gotta be kidding.
phil. what are you doing.
no.
no sir.
i have arranged to host a good will cruise for the dutch students of the local school there.
swing up son.
what.
don't look down. look in my eyes. climb. we'll do it together.
are you hating this. are you.
it wasn't hard.
the papers are going to eat you alive. even if you beat it you'll never get another commission. they want someone to be accountable.
well that's so good to hear artie. you know some of us depend on you down this way. you're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
this be it.
how old are you.
get out.
bobby peru grab you now hold you tight feel everythin' in you now stay quiet say fuck me and then i'll leave.
whisper it whisper fuck me whisper whisper whisper whisper
sorry to hear it.
no i don't think so man.
when did you talk to lula.
talked to her this afternoon while you was out.
she really say she was pregnant.
forty bucks
i don't particularly care for that kind of talk bobby.
what's she doin' here.
it's none of my business but when are you and marietta gonna tie the knot. i always wondered why you never did.
but i'm wild at heart.
are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl. or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her.
would you like to enjoy a martini with us.
darlin' you ain't seein' santos again are ya.
marietta i was just gonna leave and see if i could pick up their trail.
i'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
camels same as me guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
gee sailor. i'm sorry honey. i never would have guessed it.
in a fire as i recall.
well sure. but he was super-gentle you know. i mean he raped me and all but i guess there's all different kinds of rapes. i didn't exactly want him to do it but i suppose once it started it didn't seem all that terrible. it was over pretty quick and after uncle pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. i stayed in bed till i heard him drive off. then i just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
at pee dee all you think about is the future you know. gettin' out. and what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
sound like ol' dell's more'n just a little confused peanut too bad he couldn't visit that ol' wizard of oz and get some good advice.
too bad we all can't baby one thing about dell.
one thing puzzles my mind sugar you're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart. puttin' a detective on us. i'll tell ya lula well it's more'n me killin' bob ray lemon
you up for that.
yeah i had my first taste on that trip to juarez. at that age you still got a lot of energy.
that's disgustin'. those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. is this biloxi yet.
come look at this.
my god it better be darlin' cause it'd be the last what time is it.
i do.
we didn't do nothin' special i can remember. just talked is all.
he was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the cafe du monde. do you think he saw us.
hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this honey. you don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
not in houston. we'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
you know lula i never told you what all i was doin' before i met you.
that night in the fire while my daddy was dyin' i saw mama up in her room with santos
i didn't want to say it but i had a feelin' santos was up to somethin' with your mama
well we're really out in the middle of it now ain't we.
and no ac.
sailor.
you been drinkin' huh.
buddy and sparky come by earlier.
i'm sorry sailor. i just can't help it. give me a minute and i'll quit.
he ain't never known me lula so there ain't much for him to forget. not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us too.
how can you say that sailor.
you know who it was and you know you aren't and i mean are not gonna see him ever end of story.
did you run into johnnie in new orleans. lula are you in new orleans.
you're comin' home precious. santos' gonna drive us to the san antonio airport.
really mama i gotta go.
i don't understand this i don't understand this one bit. he was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. somethin' bad has happened - i jus know it.
perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
what's with you. you know what take care of him means. i don't call santos except for one big reason.
get rid of him.
i don't need to explain anymore'n i have you know damn well.
explain it i told you.
maybe i did try new orleans first lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
you're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him.
no but
someone's gonna see us.
santos where's j-j-johnnie.
whattya mean.
does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and santos killed her daddy. does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself. does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to.
yeah but i did and i told you all about it
is there a contract. we made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
she's a transvestite.
you're stoned.
she's still a transvestite.
i thought you were tinkering.
she left me. crabs.
that was good.
christ crabs what do you expect me to do. the kid's practically in a coma.
tripp.
shit.
sometimes we have to improvise.
is it a little late to call the chancellor.
so what do we do now.
want some help with that.
my guess vernon hardapple.
such as.
naturally you have copies.
you must be mistaken.
they're anxiety attacks. that's a little disappointing.
move away cupcake. he's got a gun.
boy or girl.
hello.
goodbye grady.
trust me i understand. i just want to say something to you grady.
it was my mother's. she won it in a penny arcade in baltimore when she was in catholic school.
sounds like a good one.
that's really it.
i guess. walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
miss sloviak's.
can i ask you something about her.
shit. he must've left it back at thaw. in the auditorium.
jesus james you should've told someone.
yes you did. last night. to your friend crabtree. is he any good. he said. and you said: not yet he isn't. i heard you myself.
it's because you don't eat.
james. listen. things things are a little weird with me right now and i well i have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. and if you hang around me long enough something bad is going to happen trust me. that's why i need you to go home. understand.
yes hannah.
thanks for that. he all right.
the aunt hannah. where did you take james that day.
he cribbed that from borges.
it's just that you know i was thinking about how in class you're always telling us 'that writers make choices at least the good ones. and don't get me wrong. i'm not saying the book isn't really great i mean really great but at times it's well very detailed you know with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on and i don't know maybe i'm wrong but it sort of reads in places like well actually like you didn't make any choices at all. and i was wondering if it might not be different if maybe when you wrote you weren't always under the influence.
i got the message you called.
i need to talk to you.
yes.
who's gun is that.
heavy. smells like gunpowder.
did you pass out again grady. did you fall somewhere.
it seems one of our students is missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
i know.
i guess you have to go on faith.
i need a ride.
i'm not sure that's possible.
tony. now that i'm home.
i'm in love with your wife.
no.
i don't know if she'd want me to tell you that grady.
neurologist. why. what's wrong.
oh. right. linda i haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. my editor's in town and i have the book to finish and 
we figure the perpetrator let him out. he's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
pier angeli 1971 or '72 also pills. charles boyer 1978 pills again. charles butterworth 1946 i think. in a car. supposedly it was an accident but you know he was distraught. dorothy dandridge she took pills in like 1965. albert dekker 1968 he hung himself. he wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. alan ladd '64 more pills carole landis pills again i forget when. george reeves superman on tv shot himself. jean seberg pills of course 1979. everett sioane he was good pills. margaret sullavan pills lupe velez a lot of pills. gig young. he shot himself and his wife in 1978. there are more but i don't know if you would have heard of them. ross alexander. clara blandick. maggie mcnamara. gia scaia.
took some talking to convince your super i was a relative.
got a job at old frank's place. his son runs it now.
beautiful. how's business.
how is she.
how old is anna.
it's made from cherry. that's a hard wood.
she's got all this new furniture now. she said it didn't fit anymore so i kept it in the attic. i thought you might like it.
when.
c'mon walter.
i don't like starlings.
why not.
i'd love to hear it.
you tell me your name i'll tell you mine.
yeah.
your ivy. too much direct sunlight. these plants don't like a lot of sun.
sure they do. but outside they've got trees around them. the trees shade them from the sun. of course the plants enrich the soil around the trees. one of nature's symbiotic relationships.
don't be witty. yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work but instead of getting off at your normal stop for some reason you stayed on. why did you stay on the bus walter.
no.
i'd say you're moving.
then i'd say you're a lucky fellow.
so. how are you adjusting.
and your new apartment.
i'd keep away from him.
no you're not.
but will he .
the job's okay.
i'm not running for mr. popularity.
it's called sarcasm dr. rosen.
that's right.
oh. it never crossed my mind.
i'm not afraid. i'm just saying that carlos has a thing for his daughter and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
we have a few more minutes.
i mean when will i be normal.
i'm afraid not.
then how do you know if your patients are getting better.
then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal.
fuck you rosen.
what did you think would happen.
close your eyes.
why.
no. when i say the word pretty when i say the word pleasure what is the earliest memory you see.
where is she. what is she doing. how old 
where.
where are you.
all right.
want a ride.
i'm all right.
neither do you.
something happened to you.
i'm not easily shocked.
the worst.
so what did you do.
no. prison is time. that's it. you think time you feel time you hear time. your heart doesn't beat to live it just beats time.
sounds like a special guy.
i love my brothers.
no you don't.
you never asked them about it.
are you serious.
do you want to talk about it.
there we were side by side on the same ship for two months. i'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers. so we get back on the beach and we're living together.
you done impressing yourself ace.
bud. hippy's on the bitch-box. it's a call from topside. that new company man.
lord almighty.
so what about michael then mr. brooks brothers mr. bmw. you still seeing him.
no i haven't seen him in a few weeks.
jesus lindsey
i think it likes you.
you see where it's coming in.
what's the plan.
i drown you tow me back to the rig
that's it then. finler mcwhirter dietz and perry. jesus.
go to the infirmary get the cart . oxygen de-fib kit adrenaline in a ten cc syringe and some heating blankets. you got all that.
cat you tie onto this manifold. there's some tanks on the other side; i'm gonna go check them out.
you better not say you missed that.
i think they're from 'you know'. some place that has similar conditions cold intense pressure. no light.
you don't need to know the details of this mission you're better off if you don't.
fluid breathing system. we just got them. we use it if we need to go really deep.
when do you have to go back.
but you just said that a month was too
but where are you going.
look i'd like to get back to lisca bianca.
but how could weat a time like this when we just well let's at least first have a look around the other islands. could be that something might turn up there.
but even here we were supposed to find who knows what and all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
i have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
you're very fond of anna aren't you.
i don't know why. i just couldn't help it.
oh sandro
and what about you.
then why do you say them.
good. it's better if it were absurd. that would mean nothing much can be done about it.
why.
yes she started to but i didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. if we had to listen to everybody
sandro i'm not coming down.
well with a shark running loose around the place i for one won't get aboard that raft. they'll have to catch it first. i want to see it right here before my feet dead or alive.
one would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
patrizia patrizia where's ettore.
but how can you carry on a discussion in this heat.
claudia i know how you feel but there are already two of us staying
and you expect to find him in here. go and ask claudia.
let's see you dive from the top of those rocks giulia. that would be really sensational. come on giulia your life is much too circumscribed.
goffredo is the princess' nephew. he's eighteen years old the lucky boy. and what do you know he paints.
oh there are as many as one wants.
but how could they pose like that. i couldn't.
don't you ever paint men.
yes sir. my sister is sick and my father too.
thank you.
no. the owners are in australia.
your mother.
patrizia don't start in again i would rather be called depraved. unless you happen to love children.
you know i don't love anybody.
yes. until proven otherwise.
pardon me but why must i do you a favor.
 you needn't worry about being attractive here.
that's because they're suffering suffering is beautiful i want to be beautiful.
who tells you these things.
god blew up the hindenburg. he'll blow me up that's what she said
why.
why.
it made them uncomfortable. and if they didn't sleep well i'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. sister where are your sheets. do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin.
everyone.
uh huh.
oh there are so many.
yes.
oh yes.
i never saw any baby i think they made it up.
where did the baby come from.
the baby they made up.
from god.
what's your real name.
would you like some.
you liked sister paul.
like what.
i hope not. it's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
i get headaches. mommy did too oh but she wasn't stupid. she knew things that nobody else knew.
an angel when she was having one of her headaches.
not my fault.
that's because you keep reminding me. if you go away then i'll forget.
you can tell me.
she can't hurt you any more.
she can.
yes.
no i'm not.
you're a mistake.
why were you afraid.
yes.
no not yet agnes very soon but not yet. how did the baby get into you.
do you know who put it there.
frightened.
yes.
so she sent you.
stay away from me
agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of god. he did a terrible thing to you do you understand.
not your fault
i hate him.
it was alive wasn't it.
and then what did she do. agnes what did she do.
here you are. don't let anyone know where you got them.
what's the matter with you you've seen the reports. it's a cut and dried case.
no no no
marie's dead mama.
and you had a sister who died in the convent.
i don't understand. are you expecting me to
who knew about agnes' pregnancy.
didn't she have any physical examinations in this time.
obviously there was.
i believe agnes is different.
that's ridiculous
she had a a hole in the palm of her hand. she could have bled to death.
what.
i'm only interested
oh some time in january.
your niece.
oh god if only i'd known.
i knew that after the fact.
it wasn't sex. it was a lot of things but it wasn't sex. you know when i was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school you know what the nun said. she died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
i wasn't. i wasn't. she was the pretty one. she died why not me. i never said my morning prayers. and i was ugly i was scrawny i had buck teeth and freckles all over my face do you know what the nun called me sister mary clitus called me polkadot livingston.
saint peter.
do you want to become one.
i'd like to begin.
but how did it happen.
she is an innocent.
but she is not an enigma mother. everything that agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. one two three right down the line.
who was that person mother. was it you.
where is she.
who knew she was pregnant.
oh don't be ridiculous.
i don't know too late to stop it.
and the baby.
they're yours.
hoop this isn't a hoop it's a lethal weapon. have you got a licence for it.
why aren't you at work.
you don't think
they'll be here.
aren't you being rather arbitrary.
well that's the wrong line for a start.
ah a shamus eh.
good. hart get him whatever it is they drink a cokearama.
did you look in here.
ringo.
morning. who's that little old man.
oh.
are you supposed to be here.
how'd you guess.
thank you.
yes.
the big hammer.
oh aye a sledge.
aye well actresses aren't like real people are they.
oh i don't know anyroad up they never are are they.
i only enjoy acting for myself. i hate it when other people are let in.
well it's nice to know you think we're clever.
and cunning.
ah.
well what's the matter with that.
at least i've a backlog of memories but all you've got is that book.
when you could be out there betraying a rich american widow or sipping palm wine in tahiti before you're too old like me. a fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the friday queue at the post office.
well i'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
eh.
i'm soldier of the republic you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. a nation once again.
hello grandfather.
you see. you know your trouble you should have gone west to america. you'd have wound up a senior citizen of boston. as it is you took the wrong turning and what happened you're a lonely old man from liverpool.
oh no you're not. you've gone too far this time and who's paying for all this.
well don't be daft i've got to.
don't worry son we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
are you listening to me lennon.
it's all right for you you couldn't get a pen in your foot you swine.
leave him alone lennon or i'll tell them all the truth about you.
i knew it <u>he</u> started it i should have known.
where's my grandfather.
what do you think are you're up to.
look after him.
eh what's all this.
what's the terrain down there.
it's basalt. rock.
maybe we can get in by the top.
what's wrong.
i have interrupted the course of the voyage.
where does that go.
there's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge. i'll go get it.
all right but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
it makes me sick to see him like that.
that thing god almighty didn't you try to get it off him.
well those things out there aren't the same you know the spaceship and the pyramid. they're from different cultures and different races. that ship just landed here crashed like we did. the pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
still unconscious.
can you do anything for him.
the machine will bring his temperature down. his vital functions are strong.
now what's wrong.
what do you mean no.
i keep my mouth pretty much shut but i don't like hitting.
don't count on it.
recognizable. in that.
 and broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
is it armed.
sandy you want to give us some vision.
receiving.
if we don't hear from him soon i think we better go in after him.
yes thank heaven.
we're going home. we're in hyperspace.
how.
we came out there we'll go back. a long time by the clock but a short time to us.
it appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort it blocks the x-rays
yeah.
chaz i've got something here on my security alert. a high priority from the computer
let's hear it.
oh my god.
10% argon 85% nitrogen 5% neon and some trace elements.
yeah rock particles. dust.
oh well you know me.
i think the best thing to do with broussard is to just freeze him as he is. it'll arrest the progress of his disease and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the colonies.
that's a flip-flop gate to channel the air but we can use it to trap the thing.
okay. first we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
a pair of incomings. they popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
what's happening.
cassie thank christ. we're under attack.
when.
deal.
yeah.
something spooking the rhinos.
what.
what. are you nuts. just the two of us.
what the hell are you doing.
careful of that edging there
wait. lost it.
nobody wander off on their own until it's found. keep in pairs. diller once the first team's done their sweep i want you to go down with annie to three-pump while she replaces it.
nah. it's got programmable facilities but it was never rigged for remote operation. someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
we had to. they were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate. besides all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where i doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference anyway. maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
that's what we thought.
hey boss. wondered where you'd gotten to.
i just wanted to be put on my own for a while. clear my head.
how's it going.
hello there. who are you.
certainly mr. dewitt
i think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. it is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly
even so. one isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. it'll be forgotten tomorrow.
after you change if you're not busy elsewhere we can have supper.
i'm not enough for a paragraph.
and that memorable night when margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in san francisco. was it - the shubert.
just some coffee.
i'm not surprised. after all that humble pie
she mentioned of course that margo expects to play the part.
just like it.
why'd call me a killer.
that's for tonight. you're invited. we're having everyone up after the performance.
i didn't mean just the theater.
i'm in love with lloyd.
you sat and talked until it was light
addison will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so i can take my nap.
yes addison.
i won't play tonight. i couldn't. not possibly. i couldn't go on
i don't think i'm going.
because i don't want to.
no it's not. it's for this.
that isn't a waiter my dear. that's a butler.
in my case it's necessary. too many taxi drivers write plays.
it could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it
i consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
completely. nor i am sure could anyone else present tell you how miss caswell read or whether miss caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
you've already met.
right here. a minute ago.
am i going to lose you bill. am i.
bill. have i gone crazy bill.
kid stuff or not it doesn't happen every day i want to heat it - and if you won't say it you can sing it
it's a pretty rare quality these days.
clyde fitch thought you may not think so was well before my time.
- guilty.
wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow.
the audition.
don't calm down.
that word again. i don't even know what it means
i admit i may have seen better days but i am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
groom.
- after all the other day was one scene the woods are full of one scene sensations. but you did it. with work and patience you'll be a fine actress. if that's what you want to be.
what have i got to do with it.
your make-up's a little heavy.
i'm in love with margo. hadn't you heard.
lemme fix you a drink.
oh-oh.
she works hard.
what are you doing here.
erasmus hall. that's in brooklyn isn't it.
so there you are. it seemed odd suddenly your not being there
you look just fine  by the way. what's your name.
good night eve. i hope i see you again soon-
not just that way. as a friend
eve. i'm fond of margo too. but i know margo. and every now and then there is nothing i want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
may i have your coat.
there can't be very much-
tell me. how did your lunch turn out - with the man from hollywood.
eve. i - i don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. but you did. more to yourself perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else
yes you will. you theater people always do. nothing is forever in the theater. love or hate success or failure - whatever it is it's here it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
congratulations eve.
right here.
it's the tight girdle that does it.
it seems to me that walking for most people is not very dangerous.
come to think of it i haven't been very pleasant for weeks. for that i'm truly sorry. more than any two people i know i don't want you and lloyd to be angry with me
more than anything in this world i love bill. and i want bill. i want him to want me. but me. not margo channing. and if i can't tell they apart - how can he.
i remember.
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
then a childish heavy-handed routine about not knowing eve was her understudy-
margo hasn't done badly by it.
when you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. it is now five forty-three. when you ask a minute from no it will be-
lloyd be careful
she's been to see me as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her
i'm beginning to catch up.
margo channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise.
after all maybe she just wants to apologize
- well. what happened.
not exactly. sometimes though i wish i understood you better.
don't be evasive.
miss channing is ageless. spoken like a press agent.
i thought you knew she was put on over a week ago-
i'm sure you underestimate yourself eve. you always do. you were about to tell me about eve
i never said it was.
i mean really deeply angry
well if she can act she might not be bad. she looks like she might burn down a plantation
i feel right now like there's one burning in me.
when's the audition.
you said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. to keep her here with nothing to do - i'd be standing in her way and you need her max.
i don't know if this would be a wise move
promise.
it was bullshit the way it was
you only got the job because both you and bradlee went to yale
what do you think.
july of '71.
fifteen phone calls
why didn't we get that.
christ and i even know somebody at the phone company
you're not a kid anymore.
you believe in the president you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
lookfive men controlled that slush fund as creepthree of them we've got mitchell stans magruder and we're pretty sure of kalmbach.
the l.a. times has a huge interview with baldwin
goddamnit
shit who do we know.
it makes a crazy kind of sense remember that initiation rite they have at the white house. each new member of the president's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of nixon.
same as magruder i don't like it when they turn out to be human.
jesus
what was the mistake. do you think it's been rigged all along the way leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered. they couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone you know what that means.
john n. mitchell while serving as us attorney general personally controlled a secret cash fund that
could you reach mr. dardis by car radio.
they never told me anything except my own rolei had to find out the rest in the papers.
oh maybe nickel and dime stuff.
on the orders of haldeman.
it gets interesting if it was haldeman because our word is that when chapin says something he's gotten the ok from haldeman and when haldeman says something he's gotten the ok from the president.
that was awhile ago
it would have been nice to have had this i sure would have liked to have had this
hey very tense.
lot of pressure at the star. carl when we got married you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split you were solvent. that may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life and now look at this. how much did the damn bike cost.
there are too many people watching methey know i know a lot
my big civil rights buddy boy if john mitchell was after your phone records would you be screaming. what're you onto.
and that makes anything you do ok is that it.
a miami d.a. the guy doing the investigating is named martin dardis.
because people at the committee were told to lie to the prosecutors.
i will not talk about the other two.
i'm not your source on that
well shit we oughtta be tense we're about to accuse mr. haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in america of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the white house it would be nice if we were right
what's this.
you saying the democrats bugged themselves.
i don't know titles.
we can't talk inside either.
i met one of the defendants mr. barker at a social occasion once i have nothing more to say.
she's an awfully good reporteri can't remember her getting too much wrong before can you.
yes sir.
if you don't like them why won't you be more concrete with me.
go on.
ratfucking.
they know but they focused on the burglaryif it didn't deal with the break-in they didn't pursue it.
hello i'm bob woodward of the washing post and mullen and company public relations. could you tell me when you expect mr. hunt. he is.
i was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at watergate.
central intelligence agency
never. please don't tell me never. ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
as usual that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly. except it wasn't local democratic headquarters it was national democratic headquarters and these weren't just any idiots these were special idiots seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning they were all wearing business suits and playtex gloves and were carrying a walkie-talkie forty rolls of film cameras lock picks pen-sized tear gas guns plus various bugging devices. not to mention over two thousand dollars mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
lotsa hints
who's colson harry.
anything.
i don't get ityou were the one who wanted to fire him.
has any of them got an ax.
and as treasurer you could release those funds.
when so ordered.
i can't say anything i'm sorry.
look when the watergate grand jury questioned you did you name names.
hi. i'm bob woodward of the washington post and i hate to bother you at home
good morning gentleman.

i just realized that i didn't know anything about you. i was interested.
umchris 
because i want to.
so you're going to michigan.
yeah well my parents wanted me to go to northwestern. i didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do i mean how am i supposed to know what my most emotionally significant moment was. so when my u of m acceptance came in december i said the hell with it.
yeah. you know people are always like what're you gonna major in. and i don't know. and they're like you'll figure it out. yeah. when.
i'm not playing.

either way works for us
who gives a shit. i've had it up to here with arrogant frenchmen.
a-duh you're a werewolf. and we as your victims have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
fine. my mistake. you know i'm gonna be a writer myself some day.

like an underground club.
it was you that night in the tunnels. you. you did this to me.
what was i. your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre. huh.
god. i can't believe it.
in paris we have an expression for people like you: enculé d'americain.
my uncle's in a coma you moron.
saint severin. the church. so you know all about the adm. where is it. tell me. tell me or else.

trust me it's her.

you were on uh the uh the johnny carson right.
yes.
that i've got to ah ah they're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes then i gotta go out there i gotta get laughs too. how much can they laugh. they-they they're laughed out.
it-but it-it doesn't make any sense. he drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. so-how is it possible for oswald to have fired from two angles at once. it doesn't make sense.
we've been through this.
well why not.
i-i-i-i would leave out the men's- room attendant.
you wanna get coffee for two hours or something. we'll go next-
how can you possibly oversleep.
m'm.
alvy now don't panic. please.
well maybe we should just call the police. dial nine-one-one it's the lobster squad.
oh god. here yuh go. oh good now he'll think- aaaah. okay.

m'hm.
you know they're- the-the horrible would be like uh i don't know terminal cases you know.
oh. italian right.
no i'm not.
whatta you mean. you're not gonna give up your own apartment are you.
just don't take any course where they make you read beowulf.
no no no what you can once you can live without it once. come on.
neat. there's that- what are you- twelve years old. that's one o' your chippewa falls expressions. he thinks i'm neat.
and then i remembered when i was a kid how i accidentally saw my parents making love.
sinatra had gl- you never said sinatra had glasses. so whatta you saying that i-i'm suffocating you.
well she said that i should probably come five times a week. and you know something. i don't think i mind analysis at all. the only question is will it change my wife.
you said will it change wife. will it change
are you okay. what's the matter. are you all right. what-
yeah where is the spider.
tsch why don't we get why don't we get rob and the three of us'll drive into brooklyn you know and we show you the old neighborhood.

you know i-i-i don't think many couples could handle this. you know they could just break up and remain friends.
hey this one's mine this button. this one you rem-
no. we're friends. i wanna remain friends.
you're mad aren't you.
the what.
i tell you this because as an artist i think you'll understand. sometimes when i'm driving on the road at night i see two headlights coming toward me. fast. i have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly head-on into the oncoming car. i can anticipate the explosion. the sound of shattering glass. the flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
why i was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
well i can't li- we can't have this discussion all the time. the country makes me nervous. there's you got crickets and it-it's quiet there's no place to walk after dinner and uh there's the screens with the dead moths behind them and uh yuh got the-the manson family possibly yuh got dick and terry-
what-
man that's great. that's just great.
tsch a few.
yeah.
i can't get with any religion that advertises in popular mechanics. look- there's god coming outta the men's room.
it's unbelievably trans-plendid. i was at the stones concert in altamount when they killed that guy remember.
i hope you don't mind that i took so long to finish.
who said that.
thank you very much. it's a pleasure.
this is a great house really. everything. saunas jacuzzis three tennis courts. you know who the original owners were. nelson eddy then legs diamond. then you know who lived here.
may i see your license please.

surviving is what i know 
damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains. it continues we better stay put.

look down there tell me what any of this matters. struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. soon there won't be a trace of our troubles or us.
i don't want to hurt you sam.
pretty clever: if the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time sam's is the first place they'll look. they may figure you're waiting for an airplane so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip. last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town. i can't afford any trouble 
mr. desmond. arthur neff. area rep for the federal assistance plan. tell the boys in dc to keep those goodies coming.

it was better than this look you i'm very intelligent. if you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope you got to be better than you're doing. if you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. i'm drowning and you're describing water.
just a second he has to go.

you can't 
oh. i got a question. jesus this has been driving me crazy for years shit listen to me. i sound like some fucking fanboy. i'm sorry but i just got to ask you. everybody talks about how you left the agency and got into the business and then how you went after the russian nicholai talinkov 
tachlinkov.

an assassin.
what does that mean.
so this is something between you and him.
why.
because he is trying to retire me.
yes.
forget it.
don't tell me i don't have a choice.
i'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why i shouldn't shoot you.
then you can have the disks and i'll just walk out that door 
you don't know that you're trying to scare me.
electra.
no. i graduated from george washington university. then i entered the agency training program.
they didn't give you a choice did they.
women. no not really.

do you have a passport.
i don't know.
but you've never figured out a way to win.
breakfast.
i paid a lot for these.
he can't. the bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and x-ray machines.
they're worth less points.
i didn't notice them.
did he explain how this happened.
what happened to her.
uh-huh.
that doesn't sound normal.
was nice.
how much farther.
it's a common question.
everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
look at that. i haven't watched the sun set in a million years. do you mind.
that's correct.
i'm sorry but i am waiting for an associate. can you hold everything for me until he arrives.
what are you having.
you guys having a go a me or what.
who's your friend.
fifteen crowns.
well it's like i said there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city so they're not private. now jahn here is an drama student at the university. he knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it until they ran out of money.
that stinks.
not bad hey i think i'll add sparkie to my resume.good shovel.
i'm making history chris nothings going to stop me. there could be a knighthood for us in this once president havel hears.
well don't get carried away.
i'll try not to i'll leave that to you. anyway there's still plenty more of it.
i'm an idiot.
none it's mine - you said it earlier i'm nuts.
can you do the lock on it.
not yet we need a few lengths of scaffold.
why don't we just take the whole damn building brick by brick doug.
you get the wine and i'll go see if i can rustle up some plastic cups.
couldn't keep your hands off the hired help huh.
you capitalist pig.
i don't want to ruin your day.
they're good guys. have you seen holly.
yeah. i tell you they're one big happy family over there.
so.
well it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
did you see anything in the files.
what happened to those disks i gave you have you still got them.
no point it'll be in czech and god knows what format. but if i'm right they could be my ticket out of here.
what do you want me to do.
42 56 76 okay you wait at dave's for my call tomorrow if you don't hear from me by three o'clock send that note and get out of the country fast.
doug i can't just leave you.
if i cut a deal i'm not staying in this country and i want holly to come with me. so if she doesn't come here today you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after i call promise.
what about me.
it was a condition of getting doug out.
no by road.
i don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. not content with causing trouble back home you idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of europe. and when finally the police do catch up with you you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out well not this time i'm sorry.
i'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here.a weekly thing.
we should be done by the weekend.
i don't want to get in trouble.
i hope you're going to invite me in.
she's tired.
no i am an actor not a labourer i am just warning you that's all.
great. and your all set for the performance.
i don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. mr vitovetch is a good friend of the judge.
i'll put one on the notice-board too.
a champion of lost causes huh.
it's all my fault i'm so sorry doug.
why don't we both forget about him.
and you broke into that room.
enjoying our hospitality.
give me a break will you. how often do i ask you for something.
great let's break for lunch and i'll buy you a beer on the way.
i decided to help out at the asylum.

all the more reason to eliminate him.
pictures from the play. jamie looks pretty 
you're fine like that mom.
i'm sorry. i didn't know.
everything's being done but it's not enough. i have to find something more.
where is he. he's supposed to be here.
i'm thinking.
don't call him a dipshit.
she's like some puritan.
 this your idea of small talk.
you're like this fly buzzing buzzing everywhere 
i know you don't want help.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
it's private.
cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
but there are thousands of them made of floating ice 
maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
do you believe you'll see your mother again.
the dirty snowball at its core.
like in a church painting. i see this giant hovering over the ground. he's wearing a robe and has long flowing hair and he's pointing his finger at something.
you don't believe in anything.
that's it. exactly. you're reading my mind 
you were great the other night.
maybe you inspire me.
why not.
it's only 7:30.
you're acting like a crazy person.
how do you know this place.
you planned this 
i made you do too many things kept you up all night 
whatever you need. whatever jamie needs. i'm here. i could start by driving her to school 
how you doing.
i saw the way he looked at you. the way he kissed you.
jamie you're not mad at me. you're mad at landon 
so talk to us about something.
how about your family.

why what.
good evening one said. agents reese  and foley from the nuclear regulatory commition. mind stepping over here.
the power of a million hydrogen bombs. and we get twenty four measly volts. it's not fair. i've been working on this power converter since 1949 and you'd think in all that time i could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy. but no. thirty three years of dedication and research and all i've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation.
exactly two minutes difference and it's still ticking.
the future marty the future is everything. i built this machine to see the future. so i am going to send shemp twenty-four hours into the future. you can assist me if you like.
on second thought there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
well professor are you sure you want me to tell you. you know changing the course of history and all.
professor. well not exactly professor. you see we don't point it at the sun.
you answered the door.

do you think i told her to kill you.
no.
you like to hang out with murderers or what. did you know roxy 
i'm very good at research. i'll help you.
why not.
did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him.
in the beginning. then i got to like what he did for me.
yeah he said it was routine too. now it's two guys saying it's routine.
nope. she did. like i say. it never panned.
before your time pop. mid-sixties. five or six hits. he's got a club down in the fillmore now.
was she ever suspect.

her parents died in an accident. i don't care what else she's written. what are you a book critic.
how did they die. was there an investigation.
she killed him.
he died about five or six years ago.
my name is jean michel basquiat. have you heard of me.
this is painted on a backdrop from the kabuki theater in japan. i painted it after joseph beuys died. a rebirth painting. i felt like he could've painted it or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. the chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else.
do you ever get sick of it.
yeah like – stupid ridiculous crummy art.
what's with the wigs.
i wanted to make a few more of these. frank's been drinking this mexican beer. it makes a good green.
gee. you shouldn't take it so seriously jean. that's why you can't stop taking drugs. you always think people don't like you. everyone likes you.
after the show we should take a nice long vacation. maybe go to hawaii. that's what i'm gonna do. i'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. i wanna sing.
is jean michel here.
you name it i paint there.
well i don't want to get mugged on a bowery street corner. maybe i could find a place for you to work. take my card.

fuck band practice if you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts – you don't wanna be like tony bennett.
so what.
uh-oh.
mr. wayne something wrong.
where's the fire.
a kiss under the misteltoe. mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it 
i tried to grab you save you 
i think you're jealous that i'm a genuine freak and you have to wear a mask.
you mean mistook <u>me</u>.
didn't i say that.
i don't see how anyway it's a treat to find you out in the world away from ebeneezer shreck.
i ah never fool around on the first date.
if my life has had any meaning that's the meaning.
course you're feeling fine you almost made a monster the mayor of gotham city.
let's consummate our fiendish union.
i it was terrible i leaned over and accidentally knocked her out 
ten nine
don't look oswald. it's a surprise.
oswald: we need one more thing.
working late. i'm touched.
big giant <u>capacitor</u>. and that instead of generating power it'll sort of be  <u>sucking</u> power from gotham city and storing it stockpiling it sort of. which unless i'm being dense is a novel approach i'd say.
i'm no cat. i'm just an assistant. a <u>secretary</u> 
in spirit only i'm afraid.
well i hope you'll stay with us.
but i can't can i.
pamela isley. i was so attracted to her i couldn't reason clearly. i still can't. she used to work for wayne enterprises. find a file.
alfred are you.
street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at oxbridge. they kicked me out. it doesn't matter. i've won enough money to do what i've always dreamed.
servants masters it's ridiculous. alfred is the sweetest most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
youwsa. nothing but air.
damn. damn is not good.
nice suit. and today you are.
i was just hanging around.
watch the first step.
you think freeze will take the bait.
we gotta get those locks changed.
i guess we'll just have to kill her.
winded old timer.
forget the stars. look here at the earth our mother our womb. she deserves our loyalty and protection. and yet you spoil her lands poison her oceans blacken her skies. you're killing her.
i can't. but perhaps tonight over dinneri've just had an opening.
umm. what i mean isno plans at the moment
what.
yes. but alfred's condition is less severe. freeze's research says he cured a case like alfred's. it just doesn't say how.
one question. when batgirl and i rolled off the telescope how come you didn't try and save us. it was the first time i fell and you weren't there to catch me.
there was nothing i could do. batman deactivated her. she's dead.
you will distract the bat and bird while i prepare to freeze gotham.
i'm glad you came. i can't breathe without you.
tell me and i'll kiss you.
gee i'm not sure. alfred. how many rooms. total.
he ran away.
what.
up here al.
_two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _second_ bank of gotham on the _22nd_ how could harvey. _two_-face resist.

she's a malaysian dream warden. she stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams. need one.
but i'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
if i didn't know better i'd say you were sulking.
you can't-.
it's dr. meridian. chase. do you remember me.
how could i forget.
i really do apologize mr. wayne. his project was terminated this morning
you _are_ two-face you would need to face both rivers both uptown and downtown simultaneously. only one spot in gotham serves these bi- zonal bi-coastal needs
why do we need you. you only come between us. we can be the smartest person in gotham city. we want the empire for ourselves. time's up laughing boy.
b-12.
i'd say about thirty feet sir.
where's the boy.
gosh i could kill you but then you'd miss my party. and you batman you're the guest of honor.
what about the girl.
it doesn't protect your head though.
i can't do that. not while the joker's still at large.
tell me knox. if you've got the story why haven't you printed it.
yes bruce i'm here 
i'm sorry i had to stand you up today. i'd like to make it up to you.
all this apparatus vicki this house and the money and the power it was never mine. it was something i inherited. bruce wayne was something i inherited. all i ever hoped for was someone who could see through bruce who could see me and not be frightened.

what happened.
i guess we open it.
you maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife. so what's my cut.

hell is other people. you obviously don't read much. besides things seem pretty quiet here. you should thank god you didn't die in italy. the deetzes. okay. have you been studying the manual.
are you juno our case worker.
he's a freelance bio-exorcist. claims to get rid of the living. but he's a troublemaker. he's pushy. he's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
if i had seen a ghost at your age i would have been frightened out of my wits.
oh honey i didn't mean anything it's just too big for you two. i know these things.
mr. and mrs. maitland. i've come for the last time. where are you. barb
i i don't know what your name is.
your name is <u>beetle juice</u>. yecch. that's as bad as <u>deee</u>lia <u>deee</u>tz.
it's <u>otho</u>.
skeleton keys never work. anyway this can wait. we'll get a crowbar later. your mother
just a minute maxie. somebody
we'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer new york. i'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture. and when otho and i get through with this house you people are not going to recognize it.
lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
<u>i know</u> i read your book <u>the</u> <u>haunted tapestries of the waldorf</u>.
what's happening to them.
otho that's terrible.
all presences have a home space. a place where they live so to speak. where do they hide out.
the injection will ease the pain and swelling mr. gardiner.
just to take the proper precautions mr. gardiner i'd recommend we take you downstairs and x-ray your leg.  by the way mr. gardiner i would like to ask you something straight out.
no robert.
i know exactly what you mean. today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the sec. all they want to do is regulate our natural growth. it's happening across the country.
 no of course you don't. excuse me for being so presumptuous. no man knows everything about another man - however very few are honest enough to admit it.
he's very intense and internal don't you think.
 and he told us that he had been living there since he was a child working as a gardener. he showed us a room in the garage where he said he stayed and i well i didn't really believe him of course - but why the act.
your family doctor.
oh mr. gardiner mr. chauncey gardiner you're not related to basil and perdita gardiner are you.
no eve. i'm not related to basil and perdita.
chauncey i wanted to tell you how dreadful i feel about the accident today but that i'm delighted that you are staying with us.
hello eve.
i see.
yes. i like to watch.
oh chauncey darling where have you been. we thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over.
the president is a nice person. i enjoyed it very much.
i see. then one more quick question mr. gardiner; since we at the post would like to uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business.
do you like it.
failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells not a damn thing they can do about it. oh they can make me comfortable prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions and what makes my blood boil what little i have left that is mr. gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease here i am getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease
you're looking much better today ben.
well if that's what you want then i want it too. we can go this way.
yes.
hello ronald.
of course who can nowadays. i have trouble writing a post card to my children. look we could give you a six figure advance provide you with the very best ghostwriter research assistants proof readers
of course not. no one has the time to read. one glances at things watches television
sure you do. no one reads. listen book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days
your appearance doesn't suggest that at all mr. chance.
might you have a birth certificate mr. chance.
yes sir i guess that's true smallest room in the house.
 hmmm elevator.
he's dead chance. the old man's dead.
 i see.
well ain't that the truth
yes.
yes. that is surprising.
yes.
well let me rephrase the question; the president compared the economy of this country to a garden and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. do you go along with this belief.
hello thomas i'm chance the gardener.
 we're with franklin jennings and roberts the law firm handling the estate.
your lunch. you have a luncheon appointment here.
1952.
mr. chance assuming what you say is the truth i would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
correct.
 in the garden.
 you will honor me and my family with a visit won't you.
no it's been a good day - better than yours from what i've been told.

you saw it once. now you see it again. that's life isn't it. and you were up here to try the same thing weren't you.
schwartz.
thank you for being kind enough to lie. you see i've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. you're hired. any questions.
imagine a room full of women. nubile blonde wet with desire schwartz. a harem if you will. me in leather. a harness if you like. i am the object of this desire and all eyes are on me as i speak. “ladies” i begin. “i am the love god eros. i intoxicate you. my spunk is to you manna from heaven
ah. yes the little door. there is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. if you hurry you'll just make it.

this is important.
this is amazing. we're gonna be rich.
you're glowing again.
let him try.
and as i said sir we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel malkovich.
a scary dream.
well if mantini wins schwartz will leave malkovich right. so if he needs it i help mantini's performance a bit give him an edge. spice up the show.
i'm sure you're not going crazy.
i don't know anything about her. what if she's some sort of witch or something.
that bastard. i'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order son of malkovich.
maxine. listen: it hasn't been me in john the last three times. craig's had me locked up in the apartment. he made me call you at gunpoint. it's been him. oh god it's been him.
did you see the reviews.
can i get you a drink.
you see maxine it isn't just playing with dolls.
well we'll have all the money in malkovich's bank account plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
oh darling. it's a dream come true. we're going to ride this straight to the top.
what want ye girl child.
i see. well it is not my fault that thou art tiny. so if it is charity yer after then be gone with ye ye foul demon.
why you never go back to lady jone's and learn your letters. you liked going there i remember. seeing the other children. then all a sudden you stop.
you got to go sometime. you got to go out there by yourself sometime.
the word. what you was put here to speak.
not like he punished me.
.i swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. she played with me and always came to be with me whenever i needed her. me and her waited for our daddy. i love her. i do. she never hurt me. i love my mother but i know she killed one of her own and tender as she is with me i'm scared of her because of it. all the time i'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own could happen again. whatever it is it comes from outside this house outside the yard. so i never leave this house and i watch over the yard so it can't happen again i have to keep it away from my sisteri'll protect beloved'cause she's mine
beloved.she's mine    i am beloved
yes. i was on the other side.
i had another dream last night. the dead man laying on top of me and i had nothing to eat. and the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said beloved in the dark and bitch in the light.
fine. but what would i do at night.
no. i mean work work.
don't love her too much.

he knew baby suggs.
but you didn't come here talking 'bout paul. you came asking about a new girl.
for what.
you remember your price stamp.
never found out.
i did. down to the cent.$900. always wondered though what mrs. garner got for my brother paul f. must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for sweet home for almost two years. but then they hung my other brother paul a. up on a tree so i guess he wasn't worth the same.i wonder what was baby suggs worth. and halle. i wasn't surprised when i found out they tracked down sethe all the way to cincinatti. her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. a breeder.
they'll know. they'll know as soon as they born. cause it's inside usstamp. it'll be inside them. we'll pass it down. schoolteacher didn't just change the outside he changed the mind.and the blood.and what it carriesand what it's worth.

yeah.
that doesn't bother you does it.
shoot.
number one. i saw the yellow man go into frank's building laughing with frank. now. the only trouble is. what does this prove.
yeah.
what was that all about.
really. you want to dance with someone else.
no.
dorothy vallens.
look jeffrey.

hey come here you stole my girl you bastard. i'm gonna kick your ass right in front of your stupid house.
nice first impression. a nose bleed in front of your parents.
two years. george i can't wait that long.
mr. jung don't you have an agreement or understanding with the united states government in connection with your testimony in this case.
what details. i put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
whose cloths. your clothes.
i would like to know the contents. every detail is important.
the coca is my responsibility.
here's the best part. we can charge five-hundred a pound.
it's nothing personal george. just business.
i would if i could get some sleep.
no my brother.
what type of planes do you have.
we'll refuel in the bahamas. i know someone there.
diego. it's george.
but you must. it's the only way.
jesus christ diego where are you. it's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
yeah. keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
estoy bien okay. everything is alright. there's no problem. okay. this never happened. no one has to know anything about this. diego i want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is. do it now.
of course we are brothers. why do you say that.  you hurt me george.
in how long. a week.
yeah layaway.
g-d son.
mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
yeah. nice.
but never mind. i am thinking we can do much together. this problem with diego the stolen car the jail is very silly business. to release him from the carcel it causes me much inconvenience. the fifty kilos could have been a big problem. and i don't like problems.
yes. money. which is what george.
please. sit down. we'll drink some scotch.
yeah dad. i really did. what am i gonna do.
you mad at me.
what do you guys want.
you hear about your old friend diego.
figured it out.
hello.
why are you smiling.
you better know what you're doing george. you're playing with fire.
no. these are her first steps. watch her.
please mirtha. i'll start working for augusto. i'll talk to him tonight. i'll do something.
you knew i was seeing kristina right.
yeah. she told me. you walk her to school.
everything's gonna be okay sweetheart. don't be upset.
you know i can't. mom will never let me go.
you let me take care of your mother. you just pack your bags.
but i have a visitor.
g-d i'm stoned. i'm stoned. i'm really
it's not enough.
no shit kevin.
twenty forty sixty eighty nine. twenty forty sixty eighty a thousand. it's all there. wow. a hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
the strike is a success; but 
the questions have already been asked. i would only like some precise answers that's all 
let's try to be precise then. the word torture does not appear in our orders. we have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. as for the nlf they request that their members in the event of capture should maintain silence for twenty-four hours and then they may talk. thus the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished what type of interrogation should we choose. the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months.
go ahead. c'mon repeat everything from the beginning and then we'll let you go. name 
let's suppose you were a spy. in prison when the nlf contacts you you pretend to support the revolution and then the french help you to escape 
i don't do that kind of thing.
yes but we must also show them that we still exist.
read it.
where's kader.
with the others. they are trying to stop the people.
no 
good evening can we pass.
but it's not even midnight yet.
who is speaking.
so what good is it to us if it's been erased.
marsh's cardiologist told me that after marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking quit drinking and started exercising every day. does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose.
that's what my report will read.
what induced it.
yes.
increase his heart rate.
 and if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine.
it would be an added stress to his heart.
objection sustained.
because she's clever. because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in marsh's condition would use cocaine.
the m.e.'s report stated that marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use. without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning. we would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
you don't know what you're talking about.
objection. mr. roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
objection. may i remind mr. dulaney that the person on trial here is miss lawson not dr. paley.
can i go.
i have.
i opened the bathroom door one day and saw miss lawson pouring cocaine out of a vial.
about a year and half ago.
how would you describe your sex life with miss lawson.
she didn't. she just left.
where did you meet miss lawson.
yes.
don't you see what she's doing. she needs you to kill me. she's planned it that way from the start. that's why she phoned me tonight.
did mr. marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to miss lawson about his illness.
did miss lawson ever accompany mr. marsh inside during his examinations.
oriental medicine.
i heard him say it.
what was the nature of your relationship with dr. paley.
while i was seeing dr. paley i mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.  three days after i spoke to him in his office he went to the head nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
what changed.
i really don't know her that well. we would say hello to each other when i would come to the house but that was about it.
how do you know what kind of sex they had.
yes it was on a friday. i remember because i was going to visit my sister for her birthday. it would be october twenty-eighth.
he said that if it kept up she was going to kill him. that his heart couldn't take it.
dristan nasal spray.
a.m or p.m.
isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought.
i don't know. that's why i'm asking you.
i want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty. your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud. they're going to say that you enticed marsh led him down a dark path.
andrew hardly needed leading. he was a very passionate man. he was eager to explore. i gave him what he wanted. we fulfilled each others needs.
yes.
what do you think.
it's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
no i wanted to be a professional hockey player.
i just left joanne braslow. she told me she saw you doing cocaine at marsh's house.
it isn't true. you have to believe me.
can i see you later.
sugar or honey.
you can think whatever you want frank but i didn't kill andrew and i'm not going to prison for something i didn't do.
why.
michael get off the phone.
humped
charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you. you were with her weren't you.
it had to get there somehow.
my jewish friend's grandmother did.
not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business 
carolyn you want these candlesticks.
mom's orders.
 going over and over in my mind every detail every moment of our time together and i ask myself what happened to me in madison county. i struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. but then i look through the lens of my camera and you're there. i start to write an article and i find myself writing it to you. it's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other towards those four days all our lives 
i don't know. i'm completely in the dark here. that's what i get for moving away.
well what am i supposed to think.
this is crazy. she waits till she's dead to tell us all this. well i got news for you. she was my mother. that's enough for me. i don't have to know who she was.
nobody did.
was this during betty.
did we want to.
 for over twenty years because that's what i was taught you stick with it. normal people don't get divorced. i can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to europe for christ's sake quite frankly i don't think he ever did. and now i find out in between bake sales my mother was anais nin.
they got heat in michigan.
heat is not heat. there's different kinds. and this heat is much hotter than what they got in michigan. you go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
madge.
pretty country.
i can't describe it. i think it's from the loam in the soil. this very rich earthy kind of alive no. no that's not right. can you smell it.
no i don't mind. i'm not from here. i was born in italy.
long. you just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there.
as long as it takes i might stay a week. no more i don't think. where's your family.
oh. how old.
about a year and a half.
i guess. except i'm one of the people it frightens.
i doubt that.
she starts sniffing me.
you get used to it.
no. i'll do them later.
do you mind if i ask you why you got divorced.
i never got lost. for some reason i'm more at home everywhere than at one place. so i decided i'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. i belong everywhere and nowhere. i'm kin to everyone and no one in particular. see once you get into the habit of not needing anyone it's kind of hard to break.
never touch the stuff. i've got friends all over the world. good friends i can see when i want if i want.
do you ever regret not having a family.
not everybody's supposed to have a family.
i'm sorry i didn't call sooner but i just read your note. i stuffed it into my pocket. the light was fading and i had to get my shot.
yeah.
how about if i set the table.
are you hungry.
yes.
have you ever been to that station.
why. because i'm having thoughts i hardly know what to do with. i can't seem to stop them.
i just wondered. why were you trouble.
what.
i know you. what can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't need meaning - who goes with the mystery who pretends he isn't scared to death.
for anyone. they'll never be able to live through the talk. richard will never be able to. he doesn't deserve that. he hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
i don't know. please
no. don't do this.
what about your husband.
franny.
okay.
it clearly states in the will 
well it was notarized and witnessed by a mrs. lucy delaney. maybe you can ask her.
you people really don't like dogs.
hey kid.
you didn't hear that. take him  something. bury him or
bones ol' bones so mean and bad whupped his mamma shot his dad.
wh-wh-whooo.
it ain't the money - it's the high. the big fat floating 'what if.' and it's way more profitable. nobody ever wins. so you never have to pay out.
all that shinin' and reader and adviser mess. that was your mama's bag. i don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
left hand's the past. your right's the present. and the future. but it's not written in stone. it's written in flesh and blood. and flesh and blood will change. see. there's something here a new line right across your life line.
but.
no we won't momma. i'll just have them call and tell patrick it's us.
told you so. alright. we tried. let's go home.
like right now there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us. fingers rotting off.
he probably thinks he's saving you from something. i'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
patrick he's
i can't find you.
where is it.
what are we doing down here.
i saw your face. you knew that place. you knew those people.
help me. i'm so sorry. but please help me
i didn't sell it.
you're right. one of my associates sold the building last month.
that's a bozo no-no. jay-bird.
you was just doing your job.
but 
need any help with those bags ma'am.
you look mighty familiar to me. you sure you're not from around here.
whoa whoa. come on he's making too much noise.
all right. where's the key.
where is it.
where's what.
not bad. what for.
if you're not with me violet then i have to assume you're against me.
you don't you can't believe that 
caesar what are we going to do.
shut up violet.
yes i understand.
un-fucking-believable. i called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
a favor.
oh i'm sorry 
yeah.
isn't it obvious. i'm trying to seduce you.
no.
caesar's mafia isn't he.
you didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
what's wrong.
i don't understand - .
what you heard wasn't sex.
all my life everyone has been telling me that when i have sex i'm not really having sex. not real sex. but they're wrong. i know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
what about that guy this morning.
shelly was skimming from the business. he came to see me yesterday because he was afraid caesar figured it out. he wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
how much money.
all right now tell me about johnnie.
yeah.
what happened.
hey.
no johnnie. no goddamned phones. not now.
i will never understand it mickey. you didn't even call the police.
our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago. even if they stayed in the car the grid is huge. this is it. he's trained conditioned they're built to disappear. you give him another day to run and we may never find him.
i think so.
so now you know.
jason bourne is dead.
yes oui uh
right. yes. of course.
mr. kane come right inpleasehave a seat.
really.
i'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to paris.

i'm curious is all.
i can't work this.
my clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
mr. howard is so heinous. he's always giving me a hard time. i get a c-plus on the test and he tells me 'you have no sense of history.' i have no sense of history. he wears a brown tie.

i just told you. she called me.
yeah what are you doin'. you okay.
well
she didn't know who to turn to. she she didn't know where to turn. she was tryin' to save your marriage.
before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol don uh we better be sure we can prove them charges.
mr rothstein. your people never will understand the way it works out here. you're all just our guests. but you act like you're at home. let me tell you somethin' partner you ain't home. but that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the governor. thank you for your time.

the good part was i had amy back. so we went home had the housekeeper stay over put the kid to bed i calmed myself down and we went to dinner. i tried to keep things nice and civil you know. but hey twenty-five thousand for three suits. that doesn't make much sense.

you need to understand and i - i'm sure you do that in a venture of this kind you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
you can't talk to me like
um i'm gonna need a bag. if you could just ask the guy for a big bag okay.
metro intelligence cop. but it didn't matter. i mean it was all about the kids you know.
it's instinctive you know.
well listen uh good luck with the joint huh.
no i won't calm down. he's my husband.
we're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
because there's one thing about these old timers: they don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. it's bad for business.
yeah i know. that's why i'm asking. you see my main concern is nicky.
you got a round figure on it.
i mean unless ace made his bet.
keep a good eye on him. he's makin' a lot of money for us. and he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us so keep a good eye on him.
tell me.
no. no. i told him all about the guy before we ever got married. this is no fuckin' surprise.
you mean like a lot of expensive jewelry. about how much.
no. i - i'm just curious you know. i was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. that's all.
i should have never married him. he's a gemini. a triple gemini duality. gemini's the snake. you know you can't trust the snake. i mean it.
no i really do. i think he's gonna kill me.
i don't -
he holds that key so tight he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
come on. don't be scared.
is that what you want.
yeah.
so what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway.
same outfit.
well how 'bout that.
no you're not. where are you. where are you.

i'm sorry nicky. i didn't mean anything by it.
this uh this commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the rothstein application.
do i hear a motion seconded.
i know but that's enough.
all right all right. but i - i -
done right you gotta do it yourself.
do i have to remind everyone that in two days we'll all be dead. the cult of good will be a memory. i don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. we have a secret mission
no in art. i try not bring up women around kincaid. it's a sore spot between us. long story.
but of course you are. dinner at eight. wouldn't miss it.
i despise these kind of winds. sorry i guess i'm a little on edge. seems this catwoman has everyone men and women on edge. don't you feel catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women
a whip. now that's going too far. some of these women have no shame.
at some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
i guess we did. when you were a little boy did you want to be a superhero.
you've lost all motor functions. the poison will kill you in ten minutes.
boss we better roll if we're going to hit this place blow it up and make that flight.
you were right all alongthe two parts to a person are the reality and the lie. i was making good money as a top architectbut that's not who i am. i'm not an architect i'm a.
cactus sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
ah did you hear that. spooky loved you
quite a little performance you gave in the casino todayfor me and that other guy. come on down let's chat.
my those little ears pick up a lot. the cult of good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. since we will be the ones performing the heist our deaths will obviously be fake. but have no fear. there will be many other deaths tomorrowand those will be quite real. i'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
i'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three. you people were once heroes. you had ideals. you fought for things. spooky told me so
for when the.uh yeah thanks a little gold piece ofgold. uh
what if i were to say you're fired.
i don't know what came over me.
oh do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you.
like you don't know
i'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. the mayor in his finite wisdom is throwing a month of the woman luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. i thought maybe you and i could
you are
i'll take your abuse but it's way too early for the sanctimonious cult of gag
where were you last night. i didn't hear you come in.
what's a powerful man like you standing all alone for. dance with me.
he ran out on me to be with you. well fuck him. everything worked twice as good without him. we didn't need him then and i don't need him now.
it was the fugitive in the chrysler that caused this. we were trying to overtake him.
no reason to kill innocent bystanders. shit. i can't hardly move my neck.
what'd you do. tail me from brentwood.
you switched license plates.
that's illegal. you want us pulled over. i'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
nels.
i'm still in my cab jammed up in traffic. are you there yet.
don't lay this on me.
where'd they take you to.
the cops could trace this call back to you.
one of them <u>is</u> a cop.
oh man. these people mean business.
what do they need her for.
26th off wilshire.
i'm afraid if i stop talking i'll lose you. just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
that makes two of us.
it's not your fault theo. you tried.

she's awake but she hasn't spoken. i don't know what they did to her. i don't want to think about it.
she's next. in two or three more minutes she'll be free.
i can't do it.
she's a child. she might panic. she doesn't know me. she might not come to me. she might just run.
rachel was terrified when i left her. i could see it in her eyes.
why didn't you just shoot them.
there isn't any such person.
oh no you were too busy trying to keep some croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. she showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
who'd ever think to look at you.
what's your point.
got a phone in that van.
it's your call.
you'll see her.
i still don't see you.
it's in the process.
negative.
and then.
and they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
and if you ditch us we get zilch.
and i end up in a fucking neck brace for life.
i just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting rodriego.

him: 'do you mind if i come in for a nightcap reggie.' her: 'well it is awfully late.' him: 'just one all right.' her: 'promise you'll behave yourself.' him: 'sorry baby i never make promises i can't keep.'
i don't know. those men killed charles to get it. but he must not have had it with him on the train.
that's all right it's a drip-dry.
who is it.
i don't but as long as they think you have the money or know where it is or have it without knowing where it is or don't even know you have it 
words can hurt very much.
yes i'll remember. good night.
how can you tell.
i'm glad. but what's all this.
this ain't no game miz lampert.

well then how about a ruler.
a ruler.
if you were a bank president that would be one thing but in your business it's admirable. and it's good advertising.
they're calling it an accident.
wouldn't it be useful to talk to her.
no.
my daughter.
okay. my secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. tell me are you worried about that girl or what evelyn might do to her.
that's where life begins marshes sloughs tide-pools he was fascinated by them you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. you'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. he made this city.
no mr. gittes. that's what i am doing with the valley. the bond issue passes tuesday. there'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. i'm doing it.
how much do you owe me curly.
i don't know
tell mrs. mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. then if i don't show take her down to the boat.
there's seven ashtrays in this room duffy.
where did you get this material.
i have a cold i can't seem to shake but other than that i'm fine.
summer colds are the worst.
uh-huh. so what are you doing here.
what are you doing here.
yeah.
yeah i once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face but she'd never shit on his chest. that's where she drew the line.
it's too late.
i don't suppose you got any idea where she went.
where.
her maid's house. i think she knows something's up.
who is he get his name. i'll kill him.
get him away from her. he's responsible for everything. get him away from her.
no.
what are you having.
i'm just trying to make a living and i don't want to become a local joke.
it's very personal. it couldn't be more personal. is this a business or an obsession with you.
well how much would you like.
and you weren't the slightest bit upset about it.
for very long.
then it was over the water department.
you sure shout that.
they can't be.
why.
what were you doing there.
boy oh boy you're a mess.
just i have to.
and i want to know where.
please don't be angry believe me it's got nothing to do with you.
where are you going.
i am not.
you mean she just found out.
what does it look like.
just tell me the truth. i'm not the police. i don't care what you've done. i'm not going to hurt you but one way or another i'm going to know.
you know any good criminal lawyers.
yes positively. that's where he was drowned
no
katherine. katherine who.
where can we go.
hello miss sessions. i don't believe we've had the pleasure.
shut the fuck up. yes i remember nothing miss sessions just going over a detail or two with my associates you were saying.
i understand if you could tell me who employed you miss sessions. that could help us both.
oh no.
i'm sorry. we don't.
yeah.
it's bone dry morty.
yeah. i do.
can't we talk about this alone mr. gittes.
that's swell. but how about here. ever worked for robert knox emma dill clarence speer marian parsons or jasper lamar crabb.
he's not in mr.
what about.
look you tell me to take pictures i take pictures.
yeah.
we don't publish a record in the paper i can tell you that.
she must be about thirty-three thirty- four.
so i can have these.
i told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. that it wasn't your fault. but i thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. now that i know i won't steal any more from you. that's all i wanted to say. i'm going.
then why don't you change jobs.
chaplin's modern times. right toto.
what is it what is it. what's the picture.
toto are you pulling my leg or something. how is it possible to see this television without film.
no salvatore. you'd better go. it's my father.
i didn't see that.
it isn't here mr. bernstein. i'm dictating it.
this is all figured at three cents a copy.
ready for dinner brad.
say with them fellows - - it's no trick to get circulation.
go in and ask him to hurry.
you and leland and mr. kane - you were great friends back in the old days i understand.
- we thought maybe if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
well then how could he write that roast. the notices in the kane papers were always very kind to her.
mr. bernstein am i a stuffed shirt. am i a horse-faced hypocrite. am i a new england school-marm.
if you thought i'd answer different from what mr. kane tells you - well i wouldn't.
how do you do. i came here - and i made mr. kane come with me because i recieved this note -
you don't have to show me anything mr. rogers. i believe you.
oh.
charlie please don't -
on the chiffonier. here.
i've got a brush in the closet. as soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
you really don't know who i am.
who am i. well let's see. charles foster kane was born in new salem colorado in eighteen six - i run a couple of newspapers. how about you.
what happened to the singing. you're not in a show are you.
would you sing for me.
oh you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
i couldn't make you see how i felt charlie. i just couldn't - i couldn't go threw with singing again. you don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you. that if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you. even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know they don't want you. they just 0
charlie. i said what time is it.
you always said you wanted to live in a palace.
it's not a habit. i do it because i like it.
what you want me to want you mean. what you've decided i ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. but you've never given me anything that -
anything you say mr. kane. only we're talking now about what you are. that's what the note is about mrs. kane. now i'm going to lay all my cards on the table. i'm fighting for my life. not just my political life. my life. if your husband is elected governor -
get out. i've got nothing to talk to you about. if you want to see me have the warden write me a letter.
thanks.
well gentlemen are we going to war.
you don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic.
why not.
what lesson. not to expose fraud when i see it. not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property. run it the way i said reilly - this afternoon a great man was assassinated -
what's wrong brad.
sure i am. she wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. if you won't agree to that she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the president's wishes. i can't tell her she's wrong because she isn't wrong -
do you think the enquirer shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases.
the personal note is all there is to it. it's all there ever is to it. it's all there every is to anything. stupidity in our government complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. they're not impersonal crimes against people. they're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the american people to own their own country is not an academic issue brad that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
sorry mr. thatcher. what the kid needs is a good thrashing.
never mind - bernstein told you about the first days at the office didn't he. well charlie was a bad newspaper man even then. he entertained his readers but he never told them the truth.
oh yes. i know about mr. rawlston.
sure.
there's a part of a scotch castle over there but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
you can go on asking questions if you want to.
oh. i thought maybe we could have a drink together.
i did a lot of singing after that. i sang for charlie - i sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that i didn't -
what did you get.
what about that apartment.
the last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
i'll come down in a week or so and see her again. say you might be able to help me. when she used to talk about kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about rosebud.
pack of cigarettes. what's that.
maybe you should take that coffee outside.
i take it she likes the guy.
she said not to come home until graduation.
wow you got thrown out. for dante.
what can i say. he does weird things to me.
so where is he.
such a sordid state of affair.
and i'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss and my desire to piss with the light on.
why.
i'm not pregnant.
i know i'm sorry. but when we started talking it's like i forgot i had a boyfriend. and then he proposed last month
well kind of sort of.
wreck is a harsh term. disturbed is more like it. mildly disturbed even.
the last thing i needed was for you to think i was hiding something from you.
sang. his name is a past tense.
stop it. he's a nice guy.
why mr. hicks-whatever do you mean.
but can we date.
so what. so we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating.
what about sing.
he's your fiancé.
so what are you saying.
i can already tell this isn't going to work.
i'll ask randal to close up for me when he gets back.
how'd you get here so fast.
shock trauma. she's going to need years of therapy after this. my question is how did she come to have sex with the dead man.
yeah.
space alien revealed as head of time warner; reports stock increase. they print any kind of shit in these papers.
sir. sir i'm sorry. he didn't mean it. he was trying to get me.
pack of cigarettes. congratulations. i saw that announcement in today's paper. she's marrying an asian design major.
all right now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight then smokey and the bandit three is the movie you must rent.
i guess it's not really fighting. she just wants me to leave here go back to school get some direction.
that's cheating.
oh shit i've got to place an order.
me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
i guess.
then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy. if the head of the empire is a priest of some sort then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
hence the empire was a fascist theocracy and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. i could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
she's in here.
each egg has to be perfect.
so what-you're stuck here all day.
he's blunt but he's got a point.
are you gonna lock the store.
what happened to all the gatorade.
you know what sanford told me.
yeah right.
no you're not.
i'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
you hate people.
an embarrassing way to die.
balls resting on his lips.
i could never reach.
listen to you.
i can't fucking believe you.
her fucking body fell out.
what'd you rent. best of both worlds.
hermaphroditic porn. starlets with both organs. you should see the box: beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
i like to expand my horizons.
living proof.
little girl. maybe five years old.
because i'm happy.
around three or something.
fuck you.
as if it's that easy.
i thought i was doing you a favor.
what time did you get to work today.
hermaphrodites. i rented it so we could watch it together.
same time. what about you.
do you need a hug or something. 'cause i would have no hang-ups about hugging you you know you being a guy and all. just don't knead my ass when you do it.
sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
excuse me.
what are you talking about. there's no fat on this body.
how do you know that.
noinch noinch noinch-smoking weed smoking weed. doing coke. drinking beers. a pack of wraps my good man. it's time to kick back drink some beers and smoke some weed.
we get off about the same time every night. we should hang out. you get high.
relax brother. what i mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. a dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit.
all right. how much is pepsi here.
don't you already have a girlfriend.
i'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
be careful.
and he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass.
uh sure. go ahead. it's back through the cooler.
aw c'mon boy. what's the difference. you said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
here. now leave me alone.
all right stupid question. but don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard.
why did you agree to come in then.
hunhh. nothing.
ooh. can we.
be there.
now making a woman cum therein lies a challenge.
do you know how many different men i've had sex with.
animal vegetable or mineral.
it's important to me dante. you have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. i wish you'd go back to school.
why do you call him that.
he requested this.
yeah. how do you think i know he liked
that's because i never had sex with him.
we went out a few times. we didn't have sex but we fooled around.
i'm sorry dante. i thought you understood.
how many.
i'm thirty-seven.
and one of those guys was you. the last one i might add which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that i've been faithful to you since we met. all the other guys i went with before i met you so if you want to have a complex about it go ahead. but don't look at me like i'm the town whore because you were plenty busy yourself before you met me.
well why did you have to suck their dicks. why didn't you just sleep with them like any decent person.
i feel sick.
peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. what do you think it is. it's lasagne.
i called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.

the ledge i know it well or should i say <u>we</u> know it well.

like i said i can't turn it off.
if he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can they'll never make it down. he needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.

there are all kinds of groups all kinds of initials. but they're all part of two warring factions. one: families that have held wealth for centuries. they want one thing. stability. group two: the boat rockers. eisenhower's military industrial complex. they want instability. it's a trillion dollar a year business. when there isn't a hot war they make a cold one.

i'm not. you're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense 
what if you're wrong. no i'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence you can't deny the possibility and i believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly profound is worth investigation and worth taking a few risks.
the point is this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
you mean 
david 
because you cut it from the budget three years running.
got a bogey boss.
 i don't understand it. all i can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.

he's very pale. covered with scars.
after this sort of thing how do people manage to look at a car let alone drive one. i'm trying to find charles's car.
what is it.
is that why you drive this car. i take it that you see kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash.
i need to see you ballard. i need to talk to you about the project.
the question letty is how are you feeling.

would that really be such a good idea for either of us.
i guess i should go now.
believe me i know your feelings on the matter.
i was thinking dinner on friday with james and meg at the saint mark.
it's just i've got those parent conferences and i'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. and shopping for ruth's dress and that that engagement dinner.
i hope you like it. it's a marquis cut 1.5 carats. they had one with emeralds around it but this was simpler more classic in its lines. letty.

your own brother. you couldn't send someone else to do it.
what is happening with the world. there was a time no civilian would touch a made man. now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. what did they take.
i assume you want something.
and for my help i would get what.
you know what makes a good get away driver. being able to get away.
why do i always have to answer the phone.
why is everything an argument with you.
you want zero to kill him.
bring me the scissors.
that's an excellent plan.   very comforting.
do i.
we had a chance to walk out of zammito's house.
you didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you.
it makes sense. i mean do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up.
don't bullshit me.
i've got a way with people.
hey idiot i've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
everything.
well i must say you're handling it very well.
what'd you guys find.
what hotel.
i'm telling you i've pulled out everything in the safe. there aren't any jewels.
and he gave it to us.  145 ridgeway road.
no wonder zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. he's planning on killing bonanno and taking over the family.
pink panther black panther. who gives a shit. and i don't remember asking you a god damn thing you little turd.
yeah i can see that.
you guys used to work together.
how.
how are we going to do that.
when do we go.
you ever hear of jet lag.
you ask a lot of questions.
i'm sorry things went so wrong today.
what are you doing.
i really thought we had something special going. i can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
who are you waiting for.
yeah. i mean besides that.  they treating you all right. food okay.
oh really. thanks. i thought it was a sewing machine. what the hell is it doing here.
i don't care about your sword.
why do you want to teach me.
i'm just playing around.
shut up.
you don't seem to understand.
go to bed then. miss has grown up and is getting married soon. god knows what the future will bring.
you're too young to understand.
yes i am. but i prefer the machete. certain moves however call for a sword.
but you're just like the characters in the stories.
i'll give them to you.
you know about lo.
what i've always wanted to teach you.
lo.
no more hitting on the head. all this trouble for a comb.
give me back my comb.
when i was a boy one night i saw a thousand shooting stars. i thought where did they all go. i'm an orphan. i used to look for stars alone. i thought if i rode to the other end of the desert i'd find them. i've been riding in the desert ever since.
go.
why. you're a wudan fighter. training is everything.
you were enlightened.
i am. he has always been our greatest protector.
no not yet
no i'd already sent them home. you can blame me for losing the sword but please trust that i'll get it back soon using my own methods.
it's not our affair. even if wudan accepts her her husband might object.
jade fox drugged her. how did you get here.
madam te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts. she's being so considerate.
no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking.
if you surrender now you'll suffer less. but if you resist i won't stop until you're dead.
sir te. it has brought him as much trouble as glory. help him to leave these troubles behind. otherwise he'll never be able to start anew.
talent. hi.
just don't tell me you owe me one. what file.
it's only a flesh wound.
at least it finally stopped raining.

mister funboy lives there.
can you play teddy bears' picnic. it used to be her favorite.
does she have a name.
now do you get to see her. shelly i mean.
well how's your friend.
i'm looking for a good guitar man.
i want you to tell me a story tin-tin.
another jolly nickname.

coupla more rings 24k.

no shooting.
now i remember. annette harrison. your father's the new headmaster at oakwood.
that's right.
i have his journal.
really. i thought he said it all the time.
no. i mean. i don't know. what else do you know about him.
you did.
i wasn't knocking anything. it's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
who the hell is taking the time to write letters spreading this shit about me.
you talking to me.
you need help.
about what.
i never said that.
you're naked.
it was fine.
ouch. do you think we could spend some time together this morning.
what.
of human bondage.
what.
i don't.
i am lighten. can we drop this.
i thought you said we were going to be friends.
yes.
please don't go.
i'm fine. i have to get going to my friends' house. was it 
hi.
it's not you it's me. i'm completely fucked up.
you don't even know me. the fact of the matter is there is some one i love. she's smarter prettier you don't even compare to her. the only reason i am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
german.
- none taken -
too bad he's in kansas this summer.
hmmm. i do believe bravo is showing spartacus on television tonight.
are you for real.
okay.
no.
why.
cecile if there's one thing i'm great at it's love letters. with my help he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
why didn't you do something.
well did you like it.
what year are you in.
just taking your photo.
okay okay. i'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
you think.
it works a little.
i hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. it's going to get you into trouble.
he told me he loved me and i believed him.
greg is that you under the covers.
and you think she bought it.
sebastian you faggot. is she with you.
i told you i don't know.
yeah.
what's wrong.
what do you mean.
will you stay here for the night. you can leave in the morning. that's when my parents get back and 
cecile's attending oakwood in the fall.
lovely. how is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying bali. zipping through my inheritance per usual.
in any event my feelings were hurt when i learned that he had fallen for someone else. someone chaste pure innocent.
because if there's an attack made on court it could be traced back to me. i can't allow that to happen. everybody loves me and i intend to keep it that way.
sounds intriguing.
if you lose then that hot little porsche of yours is mine.
even there.
fuck her yet.
the plot thickens. it appears that cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
ooo i'm sure mrs. caldwell will love that.
you're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. god are you a chump.
you didn't.
p-whipped p-whipped.
i've never done this before.
how have you dumped girls in the past.
come again.
i can't tell you how happy we are that cecile is going to be attending oakwood with you this fall. you've always been an inspiration to beau and i on raising her. we just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
don't worry it's totally understandable. most of the boys that matriculate at oakwood are very upstanding gentleman however there are the occasional bad apples.
who the hell do you think you are.
first of all maam i never touched your daughter and second i would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
kathryn. oh christ she got to you too.
it's one of the clearest memories i have. twelfth nightburning pine and mummers' plays.
you mustn't tell anybody or it won't come true.
i wonder if you don't resent that in her.
where is everybody.
what do you mean.
i called not only the boyds but the irvings. neither of them received invitations.
you're shouting at me.
some day i'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about irena.
what's funny.
i live right here.
what do you want. amy.
can't you tell me later.
and this one's for mrs. farren.
amy there's nothing there. there's no one at all in the garden.
yes she was afraid. she said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
you called me by my name.
for always then. only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
can't you get it darling.
of course. and two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
yes yes. i see prince
that one's an elm.
merry christmas.
it's youirenamy friend.
oh it is it is. death's terrible.
getting the yard all fixed up for your party amy. you'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
a lady threw it to me.
it's a pretty ring.
mustn't look little miss. mustn't look.
probably hit by a car. hard to see things in the twilight.
because it can't. it's dead.
she's always spying on me. she creeps into the room. she lives upstairs yet she's always watching me — always.
i brought you a present. merry christmas.
hurry.
good night mother good night.
yes everything's all right edward.
when i first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher i got really afeard. i thought maybe you night call off this birthday party and me with the cake already in the oven.
well ma'am the truth is i gave them to amy hersolf to post.
amy looks happy — seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
but don't you seeit's just what i was about to say to aliceamy in her own mind may not be lying.
but we have. she's wanted for nothing.
it all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
no one i've run into knows what coyote ugly means.
you shouldn't smoke. it'll kill you.
frida i don't mean this as a criticism but you might not want to talk about pms around men.
i get a little bloated sometimes.
i think she broke the skin.
why did gregory ask me out. i mean he's cute he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
maybe they have to pee.
i never thought of it like that. i never know what to do on dates. do guys still pay.
he's dead. am i bad luck or what.
hmmm. sounds suspicious.
bag means condom now. i can't keep up with the word bag. it used to be no that's not my bag meaning not my thing. but now my bag means my fault.
i can't help it. my bra wouldn't even fit. i've been going to victoria's secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still i'm busting out. it's this pms.
frida listen to yourself. if i said i was a werewolf would you believe me.
i've been here. what day is it.
he's been here all night.
don't call the police.
why not. there's been a murder.
how could i. i'm helping you clean up mark's remains and you ask how could i cheat on george.
you're right. it's just i can't cover up a murder so george won't know you're cheating.
fuck it's the cops. peter saw me now i have to let him in.
let's do some research. i'll check the libraries. you surf the web.
fall in love.
i tried to kill myself earlier. it doesn't work. i think i need silver bullets. so i got depressed and when i'm depressed i clean.
i do development for tv movies.
you hungry.
you should have gone at the restaurant.
what you got a date or somethin'.
you never say that.
you do though. you look really is that a wonderbra.
frida you know you're it for me.
wow.
no no this is embarrassing. i was returning your pillowcase and i saw you cross the street and i sort of started following you. i just find you really intriguing. i don't know why.
oh nothing's wrong. just well don't you have your period.
like i had to say it. no i wanted to say it.
you know i've never seen your cat.
i'm not afraid. frida. i love you.
can't you bite me and then i'll be like you.
maybe we should have children. i don't think i'd kill the father of my child.
no way can anything be proved. all they have are some wolf hairs. no one believes in werewolves.
cause i'm a fucking werewolf.
we can get a warrant if you like.
he was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
you're some catch lloyd.
that dude was torn limb from limb. no way a woman like that could have done it. you never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period.
deal. and if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away shoot him.
yeah okay. i still say frida's involved. she's the last one to see two dudes alive
it has to be frida. this makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
just visiting my patient.
good.
who is it.
people after me.
can't let you in sorry.
such a joker. like your father.
yes.
then we must call the police.
it's the truth i need you. i know you're innocent.
how do i get there. tell me.
don't say a .
what.
they barely talk anymore.
dave
now when she comes in we'll move you right out to the balcony. all you have to say is `thanks for doing this ellen.'
what do you think you're doing.
she's a little hysterical right now. we've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
nightmare
look at some point we're going to have to call the vice president
bob
a condition
what about her.
if we find nothing we get creative. just make something up. instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months. the whole thing is under control.
it's gonna be great. 'caring about his wife.' 'spending time on her favorite issue'
and look at this. russell came around on the trade bill.
bob
you could buy it on payments.
you know on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around
right. now whenever he stands at a podium the president always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat
 somewhere there is a distant light guiding us through this rocky shoal'
gimme a quarter.
alan

the vice-president

i saw the light. i thought maybe you were up.
that was quite a thing you did today.
you're leaving.
how were you gonna get home.
so what do you do the rest of the time.
yes.
what.
they're crucifying you out there.
after hanging up there a few days you will be mad for foodcrazed. you will lust for it. you will be worse than any of them.
then why did you come here.
his madness.could be from shock.
you'd hold us back. we have to go on.
tonight.
governor dickerson. of florida.
i'm sure that's true miss. and that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. what's happenin' underground here is just what lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. but we're gonna beat lucifer. we're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.

like if nothing else the opportunity to attend my classes understand.
that's right it's nuwanda.
yes sir. we were just talking about that.
i went to the woods because i wanted to live deliberately. i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.

i prefer the more ancient term planetologist noble born.
you must share with us. emperor the atreides house is building a secret army. using a technique unknown to us a technique involving sound. the duke is becoming more popular in the landsraad he could threaten me. i have ordered house atreides to occupy arrakis to mine the spice thus replacing their enemies the harkonnens. house atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. then at an appointed time baron harkonnen will return to arrakis and launch a sneak attack on house atreides i have promised the baron five legions of my sardaukar terror troops.
so the harkonnens will rid you of house atreides
is this what you seek.
this is a harkonnen animal. let me please my lord.

i hold at your neck the gom jabbar. don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. a duke's son must know about many poisons this one kills only animals.
let us say i suggest you may be human. your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. if you do so you will die. you will feel an itching there see. now the itching becomes burning heat upon heat upon heat.
not all of them i know which ones will.
did they try and fail.
you know i saw you perform dracula. in poughkeepsie in 1938.
oh there's my bus. shit where's my transfer.
boy mr. lugosi you must lead such an exciting life. when is your next picture coming out.
they were <u>mythic</u>. they had a poetry to them. and you know what else. the women prefer the traditional monsters.
are you sure this is okay.
eddie you got a new movie for me.
uh eddie do you have my money.
but we need to start off with a bang. something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see. mmm. what was your biggest hit.
i didn't feel well
bela. i just wanna thank you again for last night.
well there aren't too many other fellas i'd do it for
i'm sorry eddie. i'm so sorry.
what happened.
and cut. print it. let's move on.
and who may you be.
incidentally you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car.
will he be okay.
isn't he.
no. a horror movie star.
how can you just walk around like that in front of all these people.
ed this isn't the real world. you've surrounded yourself with weirdos.
look on the bright side. if we miss the rent what's the worst they can do.
ed the landlord called again. he wants his money.
but there's plenty of other parts.
look how many times can i say i'm sorry. i blew it. i thought she was rich.
you're a fuckin' mess.
but what's our relationship. are we good friends or is she just a casual acquaintance.
i understand you just moved here.
really. well good for you.
well mr. feldman i don't believe in thinking small. so i've got a whole slate of pictures for you: the vampire's tomb the ghoul goes west and doctor acula.
graverobbers from <u>what</u>.
here's the scene. loretta you're in a trance. you glide in and get on the operating table. now tor you're supposed to tie her down. but you have an angora fetish and when you rub that swatch of angora it makes you refuse so bela has to discipline you.
hey. you're not eatink.
and this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie.
and what's with this new title. my poster says i changed my sex.
ed. what's with these revised pages. a scene in a smelting factory. a buffalo stampede. <u>three-hundred soldiers storming anzio</u> <u>beach</u> what's going on here. i can't afford to film this nonsense.
why. i did all those things. hell i even built the props.
hello. you're sleeping in a tuxedo.
oh hi.
i am. how's your father.
did you find it boring.
please. it'll only take a minute. you can have some hors d'oeuvres and meet my backers. there's a really nice dentist from oxnard
i know what <u>that's</u> like. anyway i brought a copy of the script. you would play the ghoul's wife.
we couldn't afford any more props. if it seems weird maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
what the heck is this
well i was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out and maybe grab some dinner.
no. the bathroom is off limits -and when i go to sleep they go to other programming. unless i get up. then they go back on the air. unless i get up to go to the bathroom i guess then -
no. kissing and hugging okay but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
at what point.
well i don't think you can get more common than me al.
you know what would be great.
what.
could we just talk alone for a second. i 
can i give you one bit of advice. about shari.
you asked me if i had a dream. i said sure i have a dream. i just don't know what it is yet.

what.
you said that.
yeah. honey if you're watching this is for you.
send him away.
eddie how could you do it. your brother's girlfriend.
hey he cheated on her.
he says 
she could've been a nurse.
what's the difference.

mr. m. i am running on my qualifications. i would never need to resort to you know to vandalism like a you know plus my own best banner was torn down. did i do that too.
i don't know what you're referring to but i do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy everything would be okay.
hello mr. m.
well i got in everywhere i applied but cornell is my first choice.
uh-huh.
so tracy.
nowhere. i don't have class until second period.
what is it. tammy.
i'm the one. i did it. i tore down paul's posters.

i can't afford this stuff right now.
no i uh didn't know that
take me to that motel. like you wanted.
yeah. i'm here.
what do you mean.
huh. oh. uh pears
just one more thing. so mr. m. uh do you think tracy's going to be okay. i saw her face after the assembly and i think she's taking it pretty hard.
what.
i mean at you.
no. uh i just you know i just thought 
yeah.
we're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. one of 'em owns a purple merc coupe.
you say 'fuck' a lot.
actually it was two. you're different officer white. you're the first man in five years who didn't tell me i look like veronica lake inside of a minute.
you look better than veronica lake. now <u>pierce patchett</u>.
what's going to happen to stensland. he'll give himself cirrhosis over this. <u>he's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
they're yours. take them.
first i want to go on record as saying that my susie was a virgin when she died.
maybe. i don't know.
was it a rat.
then something goes wrong. meeks gets killed. maybe stens got greedy killed meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house. the night he died stens was all mysterious. said he had something big going down.
the nite owl. stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
they didn't find the shotguns. they planted them.
at least not anymore.
i'm a homicide detective. where were you last night.
we met outside hollywood liquors on christmas eve. this is where lynn bracken's booze bills go.
i don't have one. lefferts looked beat-up christmas eve but didn't act it. how come.
i needed a rita hayworth to fill out my little studio.
wendell white how's tricks <u>paesano</u>.
meeks is probably in rio or someplace like that by now.
bud white what brings you down to the basement.
dogs got no reason to live.
you guys were arrested this morning but none of you have last night's clothes. <u>you</u> were seen burning them. add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis. yes or no edmund.
stensland's a disgrace. straight d fitness reports from every c.o. he ever served under. but white is a valuable officer.
something like that.
twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with dick stensland. they arrested a pierce patchett on an extortion scam. guy ran hookers. he'd have them photographed with their johns then double-dip for some blackmail. charges got dropped. insufficient evidence. you were supervising officer on the case and i was wondering if you remember anything about it.
it's not a request. i need to know what white knows. follow him or i'll have you pulled off 'badge of honor.' permanently.
yesterday that might've meant something. pull me off. you'd be doing me a big favor.
what.
i've given up angles for awhile. i just want to solve this thing.
a guy dressed as santa has been exposing himself to kids in los feliz. apparently sir he's decorated himself.
why do men and women usually see each other.

i was in the brig. they gave me a deal. i blew up this colonel's golf cart with an m-19. he wasn't in it or anything it was the symbolic value. seemed like a good idea at the time.

yes. but i lose many merits in next life. very bad.
carefully. don't want to get shot by you. bad karma. anyway you need me.
this mission was a scam from the word go.
it was clean. very clean rambo was a decorated vietnam vet a former pow himself if he came out and said no pows the sub-committee would buy it. he gets himself caught he's a private citizen a whacko acting on his own. if he gets proof it gets lost somewhere between here and d.c. airtight. but no rambo's gotta be a hero. thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something. he put me in a corner. no choice.
that depends on you. christ look at you. i give you this easy duty until i can get you an assignment all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas and you have to make it rambo's last stand.
this your stuff.

preoccupied with what.

he's doing the best he can charles.
you're making a big mistake rennie. it's not too late to put you back on land.
if miss van deusen knew how afraid you were of
i refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
you let me worry about him okay. personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers rennie. you made the right decision.
i don't know what to say
what is your location.
rennie
hi sean.
i didn't mean for you to go.
crosstown.
say it again.
it's over finished and done with.
you used to love life. you don't exude this any more.
that's what i said eighteen months ago.
i recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
it's your best play nicky.
shoot him.
keep going west. last building before the river.
this could pbe it.
what about her.
what.
this is how we've managed to last.
in and out of bed.
is it.
she is kicking you out.
i see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
what else.
it's your best play nicky.
all right. what's been going on.
i'd forgotten that.
this could be it.
nicky comes on sunday's.
you know the answer to that.
remember 1949. last two games of the season. against the yankees. the sox lost on saturday. then they lost on sunday. first i cried for twenty-four hours. then i had fist- fights the rest of the week.
it's all connected pop. it's one life. baseball is memory. how do fathers and sons show their love. they go to a ball game together. thirty-five years later they sit in the kitchen and remember.
but the son is suppose to stop crying.
i'm lucky they don't knock down the building. it could happen anytime. and everything worth remembering is right here.
what do you want me to do.
call me frankie. and it looks like we're going nowhere.
matthew's my grandson.
then say it.
if they lost tonight they'll lose tomorrow. it's all over.
when i traveled through asia this summer i went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so i could call up sports phone in new york and get the scores. i drove through the war in afghanistan calling sports phone like every hour on the hour for updates.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
'm not worried about this kid.
game six is historypal.
to go to the theater. wears i don't know what. make-up padding.
yessiree bob.
i was educated by nuns.
so does elliot.
a little.
say it again.
is it true.
where are you going now.
our steven not only disguises himself.
i haven't come to you.
a high court judge has confirmed that mr. gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor mr. khan resisted arrest. i told you about english law.
please. you're being foolish.
take a fifth step that we may serve the people.
if i want to be one with them i have to live like them.
lots of hair and a little like a college freshman trying to figure everything out.
and jinnah.
after what they did at the massacre it's only an eye for an eye.
they are preparing for war. i will not support it but i do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
we need your help.
assuming we are in agreement.
could we cut all news off. i know 
there are a few million miles to go yet.
no <i>this</i> is your man.
there's that word again. i have a feeling this man doesn't play the odds detective. not exactly a slave to probability. is it likely that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen yearsa brutal killeris going to come to us now like a lamb.
is there something more we should know about this suspect sir. i mean besides what's on his sheet.
he was afraid of being exposed. that's why he did it.
it is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers. you've seen their security system. they know who works there. even if you ignore the man's expiration date his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
we don't have the manpower.
right now <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat. i don't think you have any concept of what we do herehow meticulous our preparations must be. we are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal. so it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. and we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders. besides i don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us. i don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
at least it's nothing contagious.
listen i don't want you to think i'm ungrateful i know you and that little brokerwhat do you call him.
you had to be a right-hander.
he was still warm when they confirmed.
the place is crawling with hoovers.
they'll recognize me.
not thirsty. we've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
you know how it is with these altered births somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
will you be okay.
not bad jerome.
thank you.
even with lifts i'm never that tall.
not that.
i've been asked to compile a log for the investigatorsthey want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
they found an eyelash.
why are we leaving.
who are they.
i can't.
what are you doing.
not like <i>this</i> one.
they may nail me into this now mccoy.
what do you add up to here.
you okay.
yeah.
what do you mean. you've never been there.
better than old times.
i hope so. i am not looking forward to another stretch.
that beynon's got a long arm.
i guess i'm kind of

my information is that fredo thought it was a kidnapping. roth assured him nothing would happen to you.

you know there's a senate investigating committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
no one can trace anything to me; i pride myself on that.

this is my boy and my wife. mr. john ola of miami.
how's the baby.
where.
that's all. you see in sicily in the old days there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative only one. if he was a traitor.
you would have killed his brother.
when he saw his brother in the hearing room he knew what was at stake. i don't think vincenzo would have done it. he loves the kids too. omerta kay. honor silence. it had nothing to do with me. it was between those brothers.
the baby i lost
however i can help you
the rosato brothers have performed services for you in the past; i understand that they are under your protection.
enjoy.
it occurred to me: the police are paid to fight and the rebels are not.

i'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague. now mr. corleone you have been advised as to your legal rights. we have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful mafia family in this country. are you.
i know. that's why i want you to be fair with them.
trust me; do as i ask.
i know.

october 21 1975. game six of the world series. biggest game in red sox history me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. we were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. what a game that was. tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning in steps carlton fisk hit a long fly ball down the left field line. thirty-five thousand fans on their feet screamin' at the ball to stay fair. fisk is runnin' up the baseline wavin' at the ball like a madman. it hits the foul pole home run. thirty-five thousand people went crazy. and i wasn't one of them.
i don't know.
not to me they're not.
nobody gets what they ask for will. that's a cop-out.
what.
no. have you had any experience with that.
it's not your fault.
i know.
it's not your fault.
which one did you take will.
over at tri-tech. one of the jobs professor lambeau set me up with. i haven't told him yet but i talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
when you think about it it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.

nobody does organic chemistry for fun. it's unnecessary. especially for someone like you.
not a lick. i look at a piano and i see black and white keys three pedals and a box of wood. beethoven mozart they looked at it and it just made sense to them. they saw a piano and they could play. i couldn't paint you a picture i probably can't hit the ball out of fenway park and i can't play the piano
well what aren't you scared of. you live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else

even though i left you never left me. not just memory but a substance in my blood.
like love.
he was trying to kill you right.
about five years now.
a sociopath kills for no reason. i kill for money.
how do you know.
you needn't be so frank with me about your work.
why not. i trust you. you couldn't turn me in because of doctor-patient privilege and i don't want to be withholding and i know where you live.
i want two eggs poached hash brown well-done. english muffin for the bread. and a coffee.
no harm no foul.
i know what i do isn't moral per se but if you could just look past that you'd see a man worth loving.
have you seen debi newberry.
the more things change the more they goddamned well stay the same.
we can't do our job unless he does his job.
all of it.
would you describe their position as inflexible.
i liquidated the last account in zurich and split it into two new ones in estonia.
you haven't looked at the dossier.

so what happened to you.
same thing that happened to you i stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. got in. got on the team. i joined the working week you slick fucking asshole so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy paul.
martin i don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago and i don't care. it was good that you left and i'm glad you did. so what do you want to talk about. you've grown up a bit. maybe i had you figured wrong.
why not.
well ok here it is uh i'd like you to take a look at my horse. now it won't take long and if after that you still don't feel
so how was your first and last day of branding.
does chicago count.
lucky for you. the grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
why don't you ride anymore. grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
the answer's no.
is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill.
well he don't know that. just sit the horse. good you have a nice seat.
how long did you live here with your wife.
i won't apologize for this. and i won't hide it. not for anybody.
summers are short here annie. there isn't much of a fall. before you know it the roads are closed the nights get long.
the point was to love each other.
no you didn't.
i think we should. it's not fair to let him suffer. he's not much use anymore. he'd hate living like that.
i think that's very compassionate and mature way of looking at it.
i don't believe this.
you're amazing. you act like i don't live in that house. don't you think i hear the two of you. don't you think i can tell what's going on. i'm not five years old mom. you want to divorce daddy and daddy doesn't want to.
he doesn't have to. it's like so obvious you can't stand him.

well did you ever think about hiring a business manager.
it's so cruel.
i fell in love. after that i never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. i never saw it like i was losing some other life just felt like i was gaining one. i know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and i ain't saying it's the right one. we all have to find the life meant for us.
what.
annie i'm not good at this kind of talk goes round and round a thing but never comes to it so let's just say what it is. when you first came here i didn't like you and i was worried. tom means a lot to me and this family. don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
wait uh i i don't understand. start again he's alive

mister laplante i really want to help you but crazy stories are only going to make it worse. the d.a. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail
spanish kinda guys.

the thing about kids is they're so young. they don't know nothin' yet. when you're a kid you think you're gonna grow up an' be a wonderful person instead of an asshole like everybody else.
you mean like bubber. the hero.
yeah like that. same thing.
he's in bed. you're not gonna wake him and make him crazy do you understand. he comes home from the zoo he wants to know if elliot's a war hero like you he wants to know how many people you killed

that's terrific. don't be afraid to be demonstrative. you're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
as long as you keep remembering why.
the whole disapproval thing. if you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life then you're back to a life of fear aren't you.  you're a prisoner to that again and that isn't much of a life.
well these are good signs she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
everything breaks at once.
an occupational hazard i'm afraid.
thank god.

some of this native nonsense. the houngan has his prescription and dr. maxwell and i have ours.
you've never said anything about voodoo before mrs. rand.
haven't i. i suppose i take it for granted. it's just part of everyday life here.
mrs. rand.
 and when my husband died i felt helpless. they disobeyed me things went from bad to worse. all my husband's dreams of good health good sanitation good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him. then almost accidentally i discovered the secret of how to deal with them. there was a girl with a baby again and again i begged her to boil the drinking water. she never would. then i told her the god shango would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. she boiled the water from then on.
i've never heard of a cure.
miss connell's testimony will be very important.
yes the redoubtable paul. he has the plantation and i as you must have noticed have all the charm.
bring me another ti-joseph. i have to keep the lady entertained.
i wish i hadn't heard 
betsy can i talk to you a minute.
can't i take it for you.
that's hard to believe after what happened last night.
surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark.
i've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
you don't seem very disturbed by it. i've always thought voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
why did you come in here.
the night you came to me in this room to comfort me to help me i turned you away.
i want you to be safe betsy. i want to know you're away from this place home again where nothing can harm you nothing and no one.
i think i do. i've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
but i assure you father walters miss connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
investigation of what.
why.
that isn't true. you never understood her.
overpriced bomb cost over $6 million no stars and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. i'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. it's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
well it's the funniest thing. i've been talking to some investors a little outside venture you understand between you and me about a scheme to manufacture a new styrofoam packaging. little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. miraculous. anyway it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor jim williams. how about that.
well hey isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. a real dreamer jim williams eh.
don't be so modest ben. it's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. you were the first to predict that billy jack would be a hit 
you know elena i've been thinking
what.
in the basement over at janey and jim's. with that weirdo mikey. not even a tv on. and they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. well i really let him have it.  and wendy came home peacefully hey should i dress for the halford's now or - give me your -
oh right. the mustache coffee cup. the one that was sitting on the dash.
this just isn't the best moment for this.
you have some marker that's what i think if you want to know the truth. you have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that janey can find them and then when i get back to the house i'll find the two of you in there and wendy'll be able to hear you and paul will be back and he'll hear you and i'll catch you that's what i think. she'll be swearing and banging against the wall and i'll catch 
hey guy. things ok up there. you all right.
see you.
it's like farming. i am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks and george clair has obviously in the mere two years since he joined the firm he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro and i assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. and the guy talks - incessantly throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department 
you should probably get dressed. the boys will be home soon.
after the thanksgiving i had i need it. you having one.
birth control.
what are you talking about.
 while children in africa and asia are napalmed and 
i was actually trying to see about getting a little advice you know 
 waiter. where's my cobb salad. you want advice ben. if your big brother were still alive i'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. look kid you married that woman against my advice 
and to think they met at a key party of all things.
now don't make me feel as if i'm being too forward ok. if you don't 
that's fine. i wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
nobody.
i know. they're rich drug addicts and celebrities. when i saw james taylor there and 
social work.
i'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about. take care.
everything's gonna freeze the big freeze.
sorry honey. hell we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
you notice anything with mikey lately. the kid seemed a little out of it tonight eh.
you going to tell dad.
right. cool. so how about we take a bath together.

you're not following procedure.
monstrous.
we had feared we were the only ones
then there is nothing.
did you kill this vampire who made you both. is that why you won't say his name. santiago thinks you did.
you said there were none.
i can't save her.
you held sway over them. they feared you. you wanted it to happen.
more.
you see the old woman. that will never happen to you. you'll never grow old. you will never die.
i lothe them. i can't stand the sight of them. stupid bourgeois parisians all dressed in black like some private club. i've searched for them the world over and i despise them.
how do we seem to you. do you think us beautiful magical our white skin our fierce eyes. drink you ask me. have you any idea of the thing you will become.
don't make me claudia. i cannot do it.
she is dying. it happened to you too but your child's mind can't remember.
but if she dies
you have to ask me for this. you have to want it do you hear me.
i can't go through with it i tell you.
but why do you want me.
yes. kill me. kill me like you promised -
it can't be
you'll get used to killing. just forget about that mortal coil. you'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
read her thoughts.
tell me about him. you must have lernt something from him. it had to happen for you as it did for me.
come the new orleans then. there's an opera on tonight. a real french opera. we can dine in splendour.

you remember how you wanted her the taste of her -
i'm so glad you're here louis i've dreamed of your coming
it's only a siren
you remember how i was louis. the vampire lestat
you promise to care for her then.
yes
what do you think she is madeleine. a doll.
you'll go away with you're college friends but you won't go away with me.

that's impossible. i told them jacks died of a sudden heart attack probably brought on by over drinking.
you're not leaving tomorrow
my father i'm alone oliver completely alone.
you should sleep cathy. lie down and close your eyes. try to forget everything.
suppose she isn't dead. suppose it was a cataleptic attack.
what would i be thinking.
what if he is.
you're planing something cathy. but i won't let you —- i'll warn them against you.
when i tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people —- a cataleptic.
he sleeps quietly. he died with a wine glass in his hand he died laughing a brave man drossos like his father before him.
theodosia.

how come the f.b.i. don't put anya this together. they work- ed over jennifer for months.
alright she wasn't lying about the van. but it could have been <u>any</u> van. any little foreign diesel. . she's <u>blind</u> bro . it's sad . she's pro- bably lonely and you're a nice guy to have around . but you're getting far too far into the element brother .
that's a very stupid question ross.

i'll sign anything you want. <u>please</u>. bring here her . <u>i want helena here</u> .

when did john divorce.
suzanne. very pretty. she was a semi- professional model. but a policeman's wife she wasn't. so one day she just packed it and left. and his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
i haven't worn heels since i was 16. i don't think i could walk in these.

no roy. i'm not gonna cry.
what happened to denver.

you're loving me now aren't ya.
the least you could do is nod and act sympathetic 
you are not allowed to act this way.
anybody else would have left you by now but i'm sticking with you. i said i would. and if i got to ride your ass like zorro you're gonna show me the money.
i understand your anxiety.
yeah man it means love respect community and the dollars too. the package. the kwan.
oh we gonna be friends now.
no i don't know.
no. a real man does not shoplift the pooty from a single mom.
i didn't shoplift the pooty. we were thrown together and i mean it's two mutual people who  alright i shoplifted the pooty.
you never had the talk did you.
not everyone has what you have.
i'm sorry i asked.
damn right.
marcee 
give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face. what i went through knowing i was going to do this to my mentor. can you get past yourself for a second.
because dr. grant isn't looking for eric. dr. grant is looking for the coast.
nothing.
well what.
he could have died.
going to the coast was alan's idea. if he's alive that’s where he's headed.
where's dad.
thirty-thousand i think. closer to the top.
we'll be broke in four weeks.
how would you classify it.
obviously a superpredator. suchimimus. that snout.
we could co-write a paper.
alan i want to tell you that i'm so sorry about the
you have to believe me. i did it with the best intentions.
anything good.
raptors mostly.
you remember the sounds they made.
which one do you prefer.
found this but the battery's dead.
a raptor claw. i use to have one. a fossil.
i have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
i want to be an astronaut.
see i was the opposite. i never understood why anyone would want to go into space. it's so dangerous. you do one thing wrong and you're dead. the astronomer or the paleontologist get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. and truthfully everything you really need to learn you can learn it from the ground.
i have never been on this island.
there is no kirby enterprises is there.
whatever you do don't call the u.s. embassy. they won't do a god damn thing.
i got a call from a gentleman who's going to costa rica or thereabouts. if he's to be believed it's a most uh unique expedition. and very well-funded.
i didn't know you weren't well.
after the accident at the park a hurricane wiped out our facility on site b. we had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. and they did. for four years i've fought to keep them safe from human meddling now i want you to go there and document them.
ian you're not insane. i'm so glad.
and let's forget about the high hide. we can't do this kind of work up in a tower we need to be out in the field as close to the animals as possible.
why wouldn't they. look at hyenas jackals nearly all species of predator birds 
that doesn't say a thing about t-rex they could have been rogues. robert burke certainly thinks they were.
i'll make it up to you this summer. i promise.
i'm your daughter all the time you know. not just when it's convenient.
that was about a year ago.
i could come with you.
ingen. what's ingen.
what.
you version of it.
it was a payoff and an insult. ingen never
what are they.
come on.
where's kelly.
all right. i'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. i feel vindicated. john hammond will too. do you have enough to publish.
he doesn't need a friend he needs a shrink.
what are you-
if we can't stay in the rex's territory we have to move tonight.
you're sure we have to.
fences are failing all over the park. a few minor systems he said.
how many lines of code are there.
mr nedry mr nedry. the embryos have to be back here in san jose by then.
fascinating animals fascinating.
malcolm's okay for now. i gave him a shot of morphine.
carousel.
but you know i should really be the one going .
why.
good. keep going now. the cable will terminate in a big gray box.
they smell.
oh my god they do not. they don't smell.
the cretaceous.
we were right.
it's all right.
it changed. why. okay back over your wrist. because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
alan listen to this.
microscopic - - never repeat and vastly affect the outcome. that's what.
alan.
yes.
what are we looking for.
i doubt it.
you have no idea.
why.
kids get scared.
and who in god's name do you think you are.
i could compensate you by fully funding your dig
robert. robert muldoon my game warden from kenya. bit of an alarmist i'm afraid but he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
yes yes yes which is why we take extreme precautions. they viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
go that's the way we're going to go. what do you say.
tim tim tim.
oh i hate the other kind.
c'mon tim move down damn it.
you'll have to get use to dr. malcolm. he suffers from a deplorable excess of personality especially for a mathematician.
i don't know i don't know. i'm sorry - -
what.
jump timmy. it's too late.
you're gonna get electrocuted electrified. the power's coming back.
don't tell me you're still thinking of buying casa de psycho
two.
zombie sluts from beyond the grave.
that's the problem with this case. everyone thinks they know jason's life story. but they don't. what you're remembering is a _movie_. fiction.	in the movie jason's mother runs around killing people after jason drowns in crystal lake
i don't rationalize anything. i'm his lawyer he's my client. that's all.
if we could prove that jason suffers from this disorder and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition
see this.
i don't know but i think he's pissed.
it's only majestic from here. when you get closer you see it for what it really is.
a glorified office block. they keep all the old records there the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
 ah but what if it <u>wasn't</u>.
the cemetery is nearer the castle than anywhere else wasn't it part of the castle originally.  i always assumed there'd be a gate or something. isn't there.
an empty tomb.
will you do me a favor then.
what an extraordinary request.
a true friend would do it.
no i left it in his office.
i've never seen him. i don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
but <u>i'm</u> the messenger. an error like this damages my credibility.
no sir.
no.
eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
and you .
i nominated you as a possible candidate. you were eduard's good friend. he read me some of your work.
i've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
when you only see someone sitting at a desk all day it's liable to create a false impression.
that street down there i always used to call it the approach road for suicides. it leads straight down to the bridge and the river.
now you're saying eduard was lured there.
first these nameless authorities were the root of all evil now it's insignificant burgel. if indeed there was a mistake and a minor one at that you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
i i found your jailer.
i think you've just escaped for the moment. just as i did. as eduard did. as they let us do. but only for the moment.
i know better than you what people will say when they have to. when they brought me in for questioning i informed on my friends the very first day.
your office is the workmen's 
 accident and compensation association.
no. he didn't seem to be. do you think he drowned himself.
he wasn't a lonely man though.
you told me to contact you if anything relevant came up gabriela is relevant. when i spoke to you before i didn't know she'd been seeing eduard.
that's been noted. but where does it lead us. unless you have something more to add.
 why take me into your confidence.
 you said so yourself the firm is large and powerful. if the discrepancy really was something big eduard's responsibility would still have to be small. no poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
accident and compensation no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
what's the matter.
of course not. only by a director of the firm. who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets.
we used to be in the supply section carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.

no. she had every good intention of it coming to me as a private patient getting out of the life devoting herself to an acting career.
i think she's trying that.
no.
he's right you know. waiting for the pusher she'd tell you anything.
i knew tom never wrote that letter.
klute knew tom. he has a great many ideas about the case 
what about your mommy.

that's terrific. that's really terrific but i notice i'm the one that's cleaning up this oh crap i'll have to do this one over.

i see. well you'll have to do better than that. do you have any affidavits to support negligence.
six years.
and did you have a close personal relationship.
ted was a good worker. but ah after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own things started to change. look i know he had problems i understand that. i've got problems everybody's got problems. but i've got a shop to run i can't let that kind of thing get in the way i guess i felt that ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
ummm hmmm umm hmmm well this looks very good. of course  you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
either you call and set up the appointment or i'll call. and if i call you lose the commission.
i don't recall.
is thatpermanent.
ii don't know
now listen before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think
you just don't get it do you. i - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
hello ted. you look well.
goddamnit joanna. what the
only can i still see him.
hey what's the rush. c'mon walk me a couple of blocks.
i'm going to be okay. the way i see it joanna'll come home it's just a matter of time.
hiya phyllis. these are the revlon contracts. i thought you ought to check them out.
kramer i've got to go. i've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on centre street.
how should i know.
oh for god's sake kramer. you have got to be the world's most naive human being. murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire fire and ice campaign. every layoutevery ideaevery single thing right down the line.
so naturally you assume that since joanna left that would be a compelling point against her right.
no.
two. she is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it. thelma do you know where i could be in this business if i had a wife that entertained or went out socially
boy you guys are really something y'know. i'd like to know one thing okayjust one little thing. did you tell joanna she should leave me.
thelma i've lost my wife i'm not losing my child.
uh huhyeah
sure.
hey that's terrific.
ted what are you talking about.
and that day your father got better. he named you lhamo. the protector.
i do now.

with much bloodshed.
yes.
yes.
general chiang chin-wu the chinese representative is en route to dromo. he is coming to meet you.
may i listen to the news with you holiness.
america we shall see.
we are traveling to lhasa. may we.
i have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
but you will always be here.
me.
do you think i must.
this little brother was terribly sweet. when he died my mother was so sad. a lama said to her before the little brother was laid out for burial take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. he will come back to you you will see. so my mother did this and a few years later a new boy was born.
i'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
and after the game we're going to trade. you just stay over there no there. norbu and i will shoot at you. i want your land. i take it. i am stronger.
we have enemies.
yes.
i will miss you.
they think they have convinced me. they think i am on their side. they have allowed me to leave kumbum and come to lhasa believing that i will try to turn you to their ways. if i do not succeed i am to eliminate you.
do you remember the day i came to your monastery when i was a baby. and you comforted me.
this is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. this is a fight for tibet.
it is possible holiness.
like my mother.
mrs. bickerman the reason we're up here a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake. do you know how your husband died.
you can't take a cow by eminent domain.
my department doesn't have any record of that mrs. bickerman.
'cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
they've been migrating north kelly this lake connects to the ocean
asia. how how could he get here.
i can arrest you.
you take care.
you think i'm <u>that</u> nuts.
you're gonna be okay.
yeah. thanks to you.
well. you don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u> why don't
oh my god.
if this is who i <u>think</u> it is. it <u>is</u>.
what are you doing.
you flew up here because your boss
okay. we're up at six.
<u>are</u> you okay.
father's a surgeon. i can even stitch in a pinch wouldn't be a bad idea here.
well. goodnight.
ssssh.
<u>no</u>. i keep getting hit with heads.
yeah i thought about that as i was driving and i haven't found somebody in my world. you found anyone in yours.
even if we <u>could</u> tranq him how would we get him on land.
nobody lives within twenty-five miles 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake. teenagers trek in every once in a while none have disappeared and none have spotted anything unusual.
i got nothing against
hey.
hank.
are you on drugs.
wild guess.
liar.
shitbutt.
what girl.
'cause she didn't drift. he weighted her down.
jack's pretty tough on you isn't he. impatient
you're all right. where is he.
mr. yow if this door should fall down -ha ha. - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number. it's our baltimore field office. they know you're here with me do you understand.
are they close to catching somebody do you think.
i've read your interim memo on lecter. you sure you've left nothing out.
right down to the kleenex i used. sir why. is something wrong.
i'm here sir i just - i don't know how to feel about it.
blue square for belvedere ohio where the bimmel girl was abducted. blue triangle where her body was found - down here in missouri. same marks for the other four girls in different colors. this new one today washed up here. elk river in west virginia about six miles below u.s. 79. real boonies.
what he does with them - takes privacy time tools he's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength but combined with an older man's self-control. he's cautious precise never impulsive this won't end in suicide like they often do.
you seem pretty sure of that.
but for catherine martin it all comes down to you and lecter. you're the one he talks to.
all his victims are women his obsession is women he lives to hunt women. but not one women is hunting him - except me. i can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would. i have to go to belvedere.
with id and a gun. impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
that's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin. he keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin so that -
that expires in one week. you're not real fbi are you.
dr. lecter if you'd please consider -
i've been in this room for eight years clarice. i know they will never ever let me out while i'm alive. what i want is a view. i want a window where i can see a tree or even water. i want to be in a federal institution away from chilton - and i want a view. i'll give good value for it. crawford could do that for me but he won't. you persuade him.
mmm. and what else.
no. tell me why.
billy's not a real transsexual but he thinks he is. he tries to be. he's tried to be a lot of things i expect.
how very thoughtful or did crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case.
no he covets. that's his nature. and how do we begin to covet clarice. do we seek out things to covet. make an effort to answer.
later listen i'll -
tell me his name dr. lecter.
senator martin. you can't trust jack crawford or clarice starling. it's such a game with these people. they're determined to get the arrest for themselves. the collar i think they say.
my god you've grown up.
i do not remember them. i was one or two.
because what i am interested in is right here
no. i will find you.
what is it.
some say that's the way of it.

seriously.
they stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. it was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
pleased to meet you.
but i gotta say i think there's something to this cold climate business. i mean you go to the beach- what do you do. drink a few beers wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. can't build no civilization that way. you got a hard winter coming though you got to plan ahead and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
i sprint the last quarter mile. you gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
i haven't seen anybody doing that.
protection.
i have some friends who have had a accident
which is why we need to talk to you about the new jailjust so we're all on the same page.

people didn't complain.
pilar is uhmis amado okay.
that was the night he disappeared.
yeah.
you stop growing that loco weed at your place you'd see a lot more daylight.
i thought he busted you a couple times.
that's how i ruined my stomach.
we haven't talked since high school.
your mother still doesn't like me.
i thought you got through that pretty well.
most people did yeah.
i was on the playground with all the other kids but i thought he was only looking at me. i was afraid he was going to arrest mehe had those eyes you know
your boy there
amado.
i look at my kids in schooltenth eleventh graders. that's who we were. children.
wow.
how come it feels the same.
how long have you lived here.
two years.
you're out early.
you think we need a new jail.
i heard about that deal for your fatheryou must be real proud.
you think he killed anybody in korea.
another woman.
otis what.
as i remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. must run in the familyyou wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club now would you son.
mister d'amour.
yeah.
maybe they're not tricks.
hokey enough for you.
you didn't think it was just going to be you and me. a lot of people believed in nix. they haven't forgotten his promise.
ever watched a man die. if you watch very closely you can sometimes see the soul escaping. and if you're very quick you can catch it.
i'm no bodyguard.
i'm sorry i got into this too late. but if you want me to stick around maybe dig where the cops don't look
flesh is a trap. that's what he used to say. flesh is a trap and magic sets us free. why did you come back.
it was more than that i think.
stuff.
nothing.
i was twelve. nix took me hostage to get swann to come to him.
quaid and jennifer
are you all right.
oh god.
i'm here harry.
whatever i said i didn't mean it okay. i get a few drinks inside me 
you know of him.
are you sure.
she doesn't want to see you. she's had enough pain. enough churning over the past. she wants it all left alone.
i can't let you in.
yeah i know.
you paid off the doctor. you set up the fake body. yes.
nix is dead and buried for fuck's sake.
we've got to get you to a hospital.
a mister quaid.
what a tragedy. it was just a matter of time of course but it's not good for the business.
he knew swann way back. he says there were a lot of drugs a lot of crazy shit.
a lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
oh yeah.
no. at the end when we had him cornered he got into my head. he showed me what we really look like when the veneer's gone. jelly. shit
and you believed him.
he did something with the ground.
and he's dead.
i've got so much power to give you swann. all you have to do isbeg.
you don't think i've got it to give.
yes.
these people are paying you a lot do you think you could consider it.
so we got you on an earlier flight but i really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
how long have you been married.
philosophy.
no how about you.
i could cut the ones that are left for you.
charlotte who.
how'd a japanese guy get a name like hans.
you're possessive.

but your patient is legally entitled to it.
this patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
it's the patient's request doctor.
i certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
he will. he has great faith.
is he going to be okay.
so all that bullshit about god and faith.
the ark sank the sun set the ark sank again.
oh my god.
that there is no such thing as evil with a capital e.
in the end the jury saw it my way.
what do you mean.
last night a guy named john townsend tried to shoot me and now i find out you knew him. what the fuck is going on.
and the point is.
maybe that's my problem.

i have never seen a sight more beautiful than you tonight.
it it doesn't matter mother. he is dead now. dead.

your birthday celebration your majesty.
perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the jesuits is. you are now a priest but you were once a musketeer serving the throne of france a throne ordained of god. can you accept this mission and keep it private.
how goes that favor i asked of you.
what are they doing.
prison was horrible but it was his home. he's been torn from it by strangers. he's frightened exhausted and the mask is familiar. let him rest in it tonight and remove it tomorrow.
you are bitter athos. you are torn by grief not only for raoul but for d'artagnan whom you love and now treat as an enemy.
hang himself.
but what if something extraordinary happened. something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else. someone whose confirmation of phillippe the king would never be questioned.
d'artagnan unready.
phillippe has been removed to the bastille to the lower dungeon. at midnight tonight i will order the guard changed and will delay the replacements for ten minutes. that should give you ample time. never have i needed more to say: one for all and all for one. d'artagnan.
you are right. but it is a trap.
do i look all right.
i have dispatches a message to fromberge requesting that raoul be kept far from the fighting.
i know.
there is wrath in me. i have learned to hide it. those years in the cell i dreamed that freedom would someday just happen the way the mask happened. now i am free. and with each free breath i feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all i lost. look at this all this that for ten years i could not see. what if i become a king a king no different from my brother.
i am so sorry. forgive me i 
are you hungry.
the old man and woman called me phillippe.
i i thought he was but an impostor who resembled 
sire we have an emergency of security. i must ask you to accompany me.
eh.
 he did but captain d'artagnan blocked his way.
he walked in on fleming and took him out.
so what.
why didn't you call for back-up. what were you thinking jesus
but what was a hair dresser from malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar.
what's this.
and who are you.
hell he probably raped her in the lot dumped the body somewhere. that's what he was like - a real wacko.
and what did he do to the girl.
they found the getaway mercedes a parking garage north of venice. it checks out.
well you figured wrong. and now i'm public enemy number one. you have an answer for that.
there's something i've been meaning to ask you stephanie.
no -
i can't help you anymore jimmy. i'm sorry.
no. it wasn't like that.
i need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
that was peterson upstairs.
it was you who did the asking.
i'll tell you the events. the psychology's none of your business. hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. graham shot him with his .38 six times. hobbs still didn't go down. he had to wade in
that could be the tip of a 't. here and here. and here.
no. the numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. it's a book code. and your message has to go out in it or he'll know it's not lecktor talking to him.
i have to.
i don't want to talk about it anywhere. if you brought pictures leave them in the briefcase. molly and kevin will be back soon.

don't shit where you eat.
i'm not eating alone. can i ask you a question.
i teach these classes i've taught for a million years. the spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. i started off i was excited about something and i wanted to share it. now it's rote it's the multiplication table. except sometimes. sometimes i'm droning along and i look up and there's this fresh young beautiful face and it's all new to her and i'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. and when that happens when i look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face and see me there in her eyes me the way i always wanted to be and maybe once was then i ask her out on a date. it doesn't last. it can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months but then she catches on that i'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. and at that moment she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face or some action to that effect.

mr. carter the head butler sits there.
there is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the equerries. no plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.

princes and lords are but the breath of kings an honest man's the noblest work of god. you must miss such magnificent views.

he appears to be standing by his horse.

lord clarendon arrives by invitation at eleven o'clock followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate princess alice's birthday. dispatches as usual at two. the chancellor writes to say that by happy coincidence he will be in cowes for the weekend. he asks if your majesty might grant him an audience.
why.
we vere thinking there might be tricks. you know surprises that you'd worked into the game
the donor. maybe he's alive inside the game.
if this is a joke i'm not laughing.
everybody's sick huh. it's fifteen after. we always meet here you know that.
alex you don't know how long i've waited for this.
so how did it know my name then.
sorry. maybe i need the valium.
it's the middle of the night. they're asleep. phone didn't wake them.
it's not just the cable system. it's in the phone system as well the electronic net. it's everywhere.
it's growing. getting stronger. maybe it's only localized now
you mean we learn the rules
and beat it at it's own game.
jesus christ.
listen to me alex. these counselor's don't know anything. they're full of shit. if you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid they freak.
and then keep on driving.
it's here
but i don't understand
they fired everyone.
home. meet me at the office. we've got to do something you've got to do something adam.
someone's shut off my money.

betty elms.
you're still here.
hi. i'm inquiring well i heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and i want to know if there was an accident on mulholland drive.
no .i.
ii meaniit's none of my business.
she sure is. she's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in canada but i guess you know that. i couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. unless of course i'm discovered and become a movie star. of course i'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star but sometimes people end up being both and that is i guess you'd say sort of why i came here. i'm sorry i'm just so excited to be here.i mean i just came here from iowa and now i'm in this dream place. you can imagine how i feel.
what do you mean. you're rita.
my parents are right upstairs. they think you've left
get out. get out before i call my dad he trusts you your his best friend. this will be the end of everything 
oh no wonder i'm starving. i'm going to fix a sandwich. you want one.
when i get back i'll have the cab waiting so be ready to go.
it sounds kind of nice being somebody brand new.
to my audition.
you're so easy.
you're both embezzling. i saw the records.
embezzling . i'm not embezzling .
now what the hell are we supposed to do .
no where. we've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind .
no . i wouldn't do that.
i'm listening.
how long till the room fills .
i've since changed my mind. i designed this place based on my belief that i was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. mccay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. it's a tax write off. on the books everything looks kosher. i have an office on 5th that i haven't seen in ten years.
doesn't anyone notice all the people missing .
just remember hold your breath as long as you can. then go right over to that corner. the door will open and go in and up.
you okay .
well surprise surprise i've been on the payroll for several years now. i still have an office and secretary. no one even batted an eyelash. do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in new york .
apparently pretty high we just got a new ceo last week.
that's a shame.
that's very funny sir. you are under arrest.
ouch goddammit that hurts .
hey try swimming. it works.
what . are you my mother .
it's my control board and i don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard no put the shit away.
respect is earned not given away trust is given away to anybody.
i see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. each one in the amount of $100000. he then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
any priors . any police record .
parking tickets . that's it .
fire the whole division.
fire the whole division. we're moving more of the operations division into manhattan anyway. whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. we already have all the key people here. anyone else is expendable.
if you want i can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. which will it be .
yes sir i do. last night's fresh from the park.
yes sir.
that mail room kid was the longest lasting guest yet . maybe we can alter the computer records and make another guest from the more athletic of our staff.

we start with the top and work our way down. we start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. no need to make the blue collars go crazy.
oh i doubt itlectures are notoriously boring.
no they're not. i wanna be a writer i wanna be just like you.
your uncle phil told me.

and you're gonna solve the mystery.
i never did understand that story did someone find the needle or not.
yearbooks always set you out for disappointment i want mine to say: nick probably won't amount to much so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. can we go.it smells like someone left their gym bag in here.

come and get it.
what do you mean &quot;uh oh&quot;
you mean this ring.
montgomery clift wait 'till i tell shelly.

but we wouldn't really be related right.
maybe notbut maybe it does. if no one told me about this i meanmaybe they're trying to hide something.
and i'm gonna use the movies when i give my report. jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
some sacrifices are worth it.
you're a good man nicholas.

thank you. grace there is one other thing
apple pecan cherry and key lime.
naw she don't mind.
why are mickey and mallory being moved to an asylum. and who made the decision.
the prison board made the decision. a board of which i belong. we're the who. the why is simple. mickey and mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
well since that time they've killed one person during their trail. and since their incarceration they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
i take it by your answer it was a whole new team.
one night i was asleep and a noise wakes me up. i thought 'oh shit somebody's broken in.' i didn't own a gun so i go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. okay it turned out to be nothing. god made the noise. who knows.
or what. you'll wound me. i can blow you in half and you know it.
say something.
of course i miss mallory. she's my wife. i haven't seen her in a long time. what a stupid question.
you'll never understand. me and you wayne we're not even the same species. i used to be youthen i evolved. from where you're standing you're a man. from where i'm standing you're a ape. i'm herei'm right here and youyou're somewhere else man. you say why. i say why not.
okayokayi'll buy that. we'll move on and come back later.
everybody thought i'd gone crazy. the cops my mom everybody. but you see they all missed the point of the story. i wasn't crazy. but when i was holding the shotgun it all became clear. i realized for the first time my one true calling in life. i'm a natural born killer.
i could go for a coke.
that's what i thought. you tell them that. when we go down those stairs i want you to scream what you just told me. 'my name is wayne gayle. i am the star of american maniacs watched every week by' how many people.
'every week by forty million people. i am a respected journalist.' have you won any awards.
we ain't got all fuckin' day.
if they stay they'll catch you and they don't have to catch you-
that's the way of the world.
so mallory calls 911 and they took off.
drink up. this is a celebration. this is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. we're gonna have the first sit down in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. this is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. this is wallace with noriega this is elton john confessing his bi-sexuality to the rolling stone this is the tearful reporting of the hindenberg disaster this is truffaut setting the record straight on hitchcock this is a robert capa photo this is woodward and bernstien meeting deep throat in an underground parking lot this is john reid reporting 'the ten days that shook the world' this is the hippies' bloody palms at kent state the maysles brothers at altamont this is the nixon/frost interviews
that dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
roger no.
what's the big deal. take out my chocolate cream filled put one of these roasted coconut-

see duff. he's the money man.
i'll smile when it's funny.
well she never gave me none. look you better find him a place pretty quick.
thanks.
and his age.
hard to get up in the morning huh.

it's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. kinda took us by surprise.
you must be new in town.
why d'you come out with me. you slummin' or something.
you keep asking me why i'm here.
damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
well i don't get on so well most places.
get out of here.
how come you stay 'round here.
well my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. nobody bothers with those kids.
you would huh. if i was you baby - i wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
at first it was real strange. hell japan is a long ways from alabama. really got under my skin though. almost didn't come back.
are you married.
no. women're always followin' me 'round.
i'll have some coffee please.
it's okay with me baby. but how' you goin' to like it.

you still didn't answer my question.
you know how to box.
it sure scares you a guy like that - settin' out on his porch doin' nothin'. i seen hundreds of them - all my life.
man we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
what about your boy.
they won't.
don't do that.
you'll be better off without me. i ain't fit to live with no more. it's just like a lynchin'. maybe they don't use a knife on you but they got other ways.
good-bye frankie.
'you will anderson.
pretty good for a one-armed nigger huh.
my son. i ain't got no son. you duff.

what did you say boy.
no they won't.
how 'you gonna live.
don't be too hard on him.
hello.
i guess not.
it ain't in me.
i guess i'll rob a bank.
oh yeah. seems to me reverend you' more concerned 'bout your good. guess it looks kind 'a bad havin' me for a son-in-law.
i'll be a monkey's kid sister. what d'you want to do a thing like that for.
yeah. all a colored woman wants is your money.
what d'you know about women pop.
sure. got a sixteen-year-old girl.
come on will.
no. why.
nothin'. she's all right. wouldn't have made it without her. christ - haven't worked in eight months. right now i'm waitin' for some insurance money. and man when i get it i got plans to make me some more. let's get out'a here. this place gives me the willies. you got some money.

how long's it been.
oh my god i'm terribly sorry. did i hurt you.
he wants to kill you you know perhaps i won't allow it.
you didn't come here to destroy wintermute. you can to save a man you love. a man who isn't even capable of returning that love. such a waste
security breach. perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
it's nothing. c'mon we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
what the hell is that.
are you sure you're up to this mr. case. we could reconvene tomorrow.
our analysis of the london stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. cyberspace mr. case a realm i believe you're familiar with.
this one's different. no one can trace it. it's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger infecting other computer systems like a virus.
working with a dead man. shit i've done about everything else.
could be your a.i.'s calling card.
let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
he's a sense/net chairman. why would he launch an a.i.
tell me the words.
don't know mon. this is a jumpship. not meant for transport.

with hypnocyl.
i used to be like them neil. i know what they're going through.
i can't believe i just did that.
try me.
the question is what happened to freddy's body.
frankly i don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
for god's sake elizabethjust try to help the kids will you. listen to them.
uh fourteen.
c'mon.
good. you conquer the demon but your horse is sinking in the bog. what do you do.
mom and dad. that'scrazy. they never said
what do you think of the guinea fowl.
lovely to meet you.
well they can be.
nothing nothing look i live just over the street you could get cleaned up.
oh hi. forget something.
oh hi. it's william thacker. we ahm i work in a bookshop.
i'm just a complete moron. sorry. this is the sort of thing that happens in dreams not in real life. good dreams obviously it's a dream to see you.
well it was nice to meet you. surreal but nice.
if that's all right.
i'm sure it's all right. my friend max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world but you know you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
you'll have to prove it. this is a great brownie and i'm going to fight for it. state your claim.
why.
because my boyfriend who i thought was in america is in fact in the next room.
i don't know. it got to the point where i couldn't remember any of the reasons i loved him. and you and love.
'very well captain i'll pass that on straightaway.'
damn. 'and wainwright'
well get a message through to him too.
you've got big feet.
definitely. 'you may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks but neither cheek. in the event of a stunt person being used the artist must have full consultation.'
well thank you. anyway time for bed. or sofa-bed.
that's spectacularly unfair.
excuse me.
this is certainly ah
it's not going very well and it's our last day.
absolutely you're clearly very busy.
well how have you been.
 with you i'm in real danger. it took like a perfect situation apart from that foul temper of yours but my relatively inexperienced heart would i fear not recover if i was once again cast aside which i would absolutely expect to be. there are too many pictures of you everywhere too many films. you'd go and i'd be well buggered basically.
i see. that reality is a real 'no' isn't it.
i haven't decided.
can i have your autograph.
where are you going.
yup.
i just want to say to tony don't take it personally. the more i think about things the more i see no rhyme or reason in life no one knows why some things work out and some things don't why some of us get lucky and some of us
no.
still loves you though.
oh no this is just getting worse. i am going to find myself 30 years from now still on this couch.
but she said she wanted to go out with you.
bloody hell this is fun.
shame.
di caprio.
blimey. what's that.
ahm room service.
'horse and hound.' the name's william whacker. i think she might be expecting me.
well fire away.
well you tell me which bit you liked most and i'll tell you if i enjoyed making it.
shall i go get a cappuccino. ease the pain.
do you ever masturbate.
i think you have forgotten what an unusual situation you have here to find someone you actually love who'll love you the chances are always miniscule. look at me not counting the american i've only loved two girls in my whole life both total disasters.
oh god no.
yes might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
it's not yogurt it's mayonnaise.
imagine somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
well it was genuinely bizarre she said hi it's anna and then she said call me at the ritz and then gave herself a completely different name.
spike.
spike. for god's sake she's in trouble get a grip.
no secrets mister harding. let's get it all out in the open
i was in luh-love with her.
sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it.
billy that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly

i'm sorry mister mcmurphy i count only eight.
you mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there.
mr. mcmurphy you had no right to take these men out with you.

it's the questions she asks.
what. what.
so long freddy. don't take any wooden nickles.
i'm not talking about fred yoong or maxwell jones buddy what i'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you.
lobotomy.
it doesn't help him.
no.
gimme the ball.
i wanna go home.
man there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
oh what's that.
well ya know doc doesn't it say so there.
ah it seems you have no other psychiatric history mister murphy.
well i was turnin' this dilemma over in my head when i happened to hit on that old tub room out there an' i said to myself mcmurphy i said that place would make a great second day room. a sort of game room for the young fellas. whadaya think doc.
jesus that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling don't she.
time out.
pardon me miss but would you mind turning
how do ya know that.
you think it's funny huh.
yeah.
how much ya wanna bet.
yeah take us back to the dumbwaiter mac.
i tell ya there's an angel of mercy standing out there turkle.
now wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake.
you know i never got your name.
hi.
maybe i'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram sefelt.
make yourself at home mister mcmurphy
why sure ma'am
you've been drinking on the job again haven't you mister turkle.
what happened.
are they dangerous when they're awake.
you ol' fucker.
of course not.
nobody here has any idea which way he went.
why.
were they pen pals.
nothing you could say would change the way i feel.
we'll know.
i'll bring it back as soon as i can.
dwayne pinsley. i'm trying to reach dwayne pinsley.
uh in case dwayne wants to try to reach you.
you didn't answer my question.
there must be something i can do something i can say to make this up to you. just tell me what it is i'll say it. i'll do it. i don't want you to hate me.
fine. okay. forget me. leave me out of it. but don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
so. you found him.
i'm sorry.
no. i mean yes i'm not. i decided to call it off. well actually it was kind of mutual.
i'd call that a yes. do i get a hint.
what.
very funny.
been here long.
sure.
i don't know i guess i never really thought about it is larry here.
metaphorically i still don't have an amana freezer.
so what's your point.
no.
look how big it makes me look. i look like an alp.
you don't have a passport.
live happily ever after.
this is a lifestyles hotel.
i just got a dial tone
only what.
i don't know kate. i just said that. i'm sorry. i'm just on edge. i'm afraid we're losing him.
'course he does.
and then what faith.
that was really sweet
i meant about my idea.
yeah. sociopaths. they're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
i thought you were the one who didn't think i should've come in the first place.
what about peter.
you sure you'll be okay.
kate. thank god you're there. i need help.
so
i'm fine. have you seen peter.
she's saying he's a a porco.
how old are you.
this is the last one before the wedding right.
not only is it tacky it's exploitation.
sociologist. and because. pawn shops are just like prostitutes farm auctions and coal miners. they're all for sale but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
it was an emergency. i only lied that night because it was the only way i knew to stop her. i knew if i didn't i'd never see her again.
good strategy.
and then i saw her. and all i know is when i looked in her eyes i saw something light. and life and passion and yearning. and something else i can't even put my finger on something i'd never seen before
mania.
i'm gonna take her home first.
and don't be walking off with any of that. you know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
you mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records.
the joey doyle thing. you know how he is. things like that— he exaggerates them. too much marquis of queensbury. it softens 'em up.
working hard.
i just fnished work. i counted the bags.
why me charley. i'd feel funny going in there.
i've got to cover a bet there on the way over. anyway it gives us a chance to talk.
the grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— .
i could have been better.
wow .
time and faith . my brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
thanks. steel pipes and baseball bats.
i'll get home all right now.
everybody loved joey. from the little kids to the old rummies. did you know him very well.
i can get home all right from here—
now you got me. it's a wonder i wasn't punchy by the time i was twelve. the rulers those sisters used to whack me with. they thought they could beat an education into me—i foxed 'em.
i don't know.
no thanks .
i went pretty good for a while didn't i al. but— i didn't stay in shape— and— —i had to take a few dives.
our lord said just the opposite.
i never met such a person. not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
i'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— what more do you want.
i— i brought this for you terry. it was joey's. yours is coming out at the elbows.
what i did to joey.
i don't want to hurt charley— i don't want to hurt you
i'll take it out of their skulls.
do what i told you. take care of charley.
am i on my feet.
who is he pop.
he wasn't abyssinian pop assyrian .
i don't want to hear it in there.
you go to hell.
never will be much too soon.
you're being served with a subpoena mr. malloy.
what's the matter wit' you success gone to ya head.
hey skins— get away with that sheet metal all right.
count this.
my favorite little cousin.
i thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
nothing happened johnny.
it was a big nothing. the father did all the talking.
oh he did. half an hour later a certain timothy j. nolan went into secret session with the commission and he did all the talking.
you want to know the trouble with you. you think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
from where you stand maybe. but i'm standing over here now. i was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it helpin' punks like you against people like pop and nolan an' .
i can look at her can't i. it's a free country.
tippi-tippi-tim tippi-tim tippi-tippi-tan tippi-tan gotta dime for a crippled-up docker.
the brother of charley the gent. they'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
but does it have to be in a cemetery.
what help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night.
i'm not sure
be careful.
my guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon we're not going to have much life left anyway.
be careful oh please be careful. we'll never get out of here alive i know it. i just feel it.
i still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
you better hope there is.
he wants us.
you know that super bowl party. they changed the date. it's on <u>tonight</u> eight-thirty.
what's free about it. i'm looking for work.
listen adele the reason i called that party is today instead of sunday. about eight-thirty like only a few hours from now. so you'll have to get hold of buddy whatever he might be doing
and the one driving the other car.
you do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside.
he said he wished the two of you could start over live a normal life.
jack came out of a bank he just robbed in pasadena couldn't get his stolen car to start. battery was dead. he looks over sees buddy sitting in a burgundy bonneville goes up offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. turns out buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing. buddy says i'll take the thousand but we're leaving in my car not that piece of shit you come in. they musta robbed fifty banks together.
ask him his name.
you did work for emil right.
where in the hell are we.
why you brought glenn into this i'll never know.
how 'bout the score was his idea to begin with.
longer we hang around down here jack better chance there is either glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score or we gonna get busted or both.
he's running for his life he doesn't give a shit about you.
let's go to detroit.
forget about my sister. if karen sisco's tailing glenn we're fucked. tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.

not until recently.
yeah i liked her in that movie about tv
yeah right. anyway that scene where warren beatty and faye dunaway get shot. i remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go if you have to.
you're sure easy to talk to. i wonder say we met under different circumstances and got to talking say you were in a bar and i came up to you i wonder what would happen.
that's my dad.
whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island.

you just did for christ sake.
wait in the car.
you're in civilization now man ease up.
i'd like you to go wait in the car. how's that. take her with you and put her in back.
you don't wanna be standing there the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.

jesus christ what the hell are you doing here. what's going on. who's upstairs.
islamic.
glenn are you trying to steal this car.
for the car for aiding and abetting a prison escape and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.

if macrosystems wins an energetic young company will be destroyed five thousand americans will be out of work. moreover the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit macrosystems is trying to pull.
yes.
jesus.
i almost didn't make it to the bathroom miguel. i almost lost control right in front of everybody.
that's the third time. i better call the office. would you relax please.
you're leaving the hospital. you're going into the office looking like that. are you insane.
hold still. shit. the goddamn vein's clotted. we have to go the goddamn hospital so they can change the goddamn catheter.
the least you can do is look at me while i'm sticking this shit into your arm. forget the fucking case one hour a day and give me a little of your time.
maybe you should think about it.
that's right. we're on the positive plan. you don't have a fatal disease you have manageable illness.
ready for what baby.
jesus christ what happened to you.
new baby.
my lover and i.
parrtyy.

then we establish how wheeler's boys recruited you after law school
i'll look over the q and a.
particularly charles.

no. i didn't.
yes.
as a homosexual one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality is that right.
miguel has not been infected. as i said we weren't aware of aids then or how it is spread.
hello.
what's dr. gillman say.
all i know is you got through your diagnosis fine like a trooper. but when they fired you you were so devastated andy i don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. fight for your rights.
he was losing weight. he looked kind of tired sometimes. but he was working so hard still i felt something was wrong. and i can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
yes.
objection.
andrew beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990 is that correct.
let's put it this way andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
what kind of people.
great.
yeah .
two men making love . now tell me again <u>why</u> is that disgusting.
how did you do that.
i <u>know</u> the difference. that doesn't mean i'm always able to recognize the difference.
 interview every employee support staff associates partners. did <u>any</u> of them know andy was sick. <u>how</u> did they know. did he tell them. did they notice something was wrong with his appearance. none of this information got to the managing partners. we know that. make sure everyone else does too and beckett: i want to know everything about his personal life. did he frequent those pathetic bars on camac street.
 keep them from that area on grounds of relevancy. what bob.
oh lord.
then where is he. he's not in the hole. we looked.

sorry. thought i heard something.
i <u>know</u> what happened he went off on the guy buried him on the hill somewhere and now he's trying to 
hey. bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before it's just stupid.
my first run-in with riddick. went for the sweet-spot and missed. they had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. i can feel it sometimes pressing against the cord. so maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
hey <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here turned me into a goddamn sled dog. an' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog.
company's not here is it.
when captain went down you stepped up whether you like it or not. now they train you for this so 
owens.
i don't suppose.
don't stop just slow down. little more space 'tween us and them.
'cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. and you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. oh absolutely i believe in god. and i absolutely hate the fucker.
suleiman.
new mecca.

don't speak to me in absolutes. the evidence is contestable.
if there's any shooting dr. zaius you'll be the first to die. depend on it.

dodge he's not like me at all. but he makes sense. held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. i understand why he's here. but youyou're no seeker. you're negative.
if you insist. but i'm not taking any orders 
always giving orders. just like every other adult.
i want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
a man dr. maximus.
welldo you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures.
i told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
that's exactly what zira and cornelius claim. you're talking heresy doctor.
i'm not protecting anybody. that hearing was a farce. what have i done.
we're back at the beginning. i still don't know the why. a planet where apes evolved from men. a world turned wrong side up. a puzzle with one piece missing.
my - name - isn't - bright eyes it's taylor.
where have you been. why didn't you come to see me.
why not.
dr. zira you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.

not the only man to meet his jezebel either.
you wanted to see me sir.
suppose i hadn't known that immigration inspector. hadn't put in a good word for you.
dine and dance tonight. i've got fifty bucks to throw away.
what's the matter.
immigration officer.
they might think i was running away from something.
a fellow named brandon has a penthouse here. he's holding open house. i was up there. too noisy. bored.
what did you say his name was.
you're not paying for this. it's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
whatever you say.
do you think i don't.
go aheadif you want to. it doesn't matter.
there wasn't any plane.
dance. tonight.
cold.
we walked right passed him. he's following us.
it sounds like a fair location. could you be a little more exact.
i'm in the hudson bay company's store. that man last nightthe one that followed me
if they had any reason to. why make it tough for themselves. why go to all that trouble. here's an open book. close it. no reason to keep it open. she was a nice girl anyway. and perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose. perhaps she didn't kill the other one. you never know. give her the benefit of the doubt. leave her stay where she is. close the book. finis.
killaine
well.
that and the fun of it.
including killainei still can't think of you that way.
i guess i'm a little screwy. maybe i could believe it. should i try.
magruder does.
do you think i was faking.
i'm sorry.
you were a galahad compared to some cops i've known.
but not in the investigation of a major crime i hope.
youor the vancouver police department.
good morning mr. brandon.
i'd like a few words with you in private.
you guessed it. the card's phony. i got plenty of 'em. different names different jobs. i work out of san francisco. go anywhere do anything. all it takes is the folding.
you hurt my feelings. i ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
if i call the police your price will go down to a minus sign.
i go home and paint the kitchen.
there's two hundred. i'll meet you in an hourwhere we met last night
who told you my name.
what's this in favor of.
she doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
on miss mayfield's balcony. beside the chaise i picked it up. don't ask me why. i ought to know better.
i rather thought so. and before that had you ever seen the gun.
money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others. very appealing especially to a poor man.
it could have been an accident.
how could mitchell. after that act he put on up here is it likely she'd let him in.
i'm afraid they do. far too often. so long.
now and then. mostly just for the fun of it.
you don't throw guests out brandon.
i'm getting positively haggard. in a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
so much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
i don't think you locked your door.
with what motive.
floater.
this make of gun throws a shell backwards high and to the right. the chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
i'll know when i find it.
exactly. now i'm the killer. and there's something i don't want you to know. something that would destroy my comfortable life rob me of my friends my position.
he could have tried. if he was up there in the dark listening he'd know when she came home know when she found mitchell dead know what she did about it. if she telephoned he'd probably hear that.
greer and goble in the call building san francisco. just like you thoughttwo murders in two days. different places different methods different people. nothing connects them but a telephone number.
then why not give miss mayfield the benefit of the doubt.
i'll investigate mr. clarendon's financial position
perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
how about magruder.
the card says so doesn't it.
am i to interpret that as an order to arrest miss mayfield.
i don't know sir.
what are my orders sir.
she's just a girl i met on the train. you don't mind do you.
you shouldn't. you washed me up very thoroughly.
she's very beautiful. she's much younger than i am. and she's rich i hope.
that's not very kind.
you already have the checks darling.
you're very attractive my dear. and you look very unsophisticated.
it's kind of you to see me.
my first husband worked for the bbc. i doubt if anyone there remembers him now just another long dead diligent administrator. he would have been useful in the fight to preserve the bbc's independence during the suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about. i became involved too. i started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of suez. then he died and i loots the will to write it. by the time i was over his death other books had been published and it wasn't worth going on.
it wasn't much more than a pot boiler.suez was very important for our generation. i didn't want it to be forgotten. and that's why i'd like to be able to help you. but really mr. penfield i looked through my notes before you came they're all very much out of date there's been so much published since. i don't think i'm your man.
it's fine thank you.
so i can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.i shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
hello. anyone for a walk. tom isn't i can tell you.
then i began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now — the war had just ended and the language was much the same as it had been before the first reform act. a small minority thought that england was really theirs they had made it they owned it. the rest the wage earners were foreigners outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
not too bad thanks. how have you been.
working hard on that book i was telling you about. coming to the meeting.
i think you're exaggerating. and if you aren't you should jolly well change your job.
it makes me weepy just to remember it. so we were fine again and then she got married to matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob but quite nice really makes tv commercials. what about yours.
in your car
to the fleet.
she's never written a book in it but she clearly knew a lot.
delivering gossip and goodwill. it seems we'll both be doing brighton. perhaps you should come too.
i've got to be going. i've got a meeting tonight.
the bed's all made up if you want to stay.
i'll tell you another thing. we might have led the world once into the industrial revolution now we lead with television commercials. we're the best it's as simple as that. even the americans will admit it now the camera work the acting the scripts special effects. we've got the lot. nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films. that food you're eating.
now listen
ah susy it
ever done this before.
once.
sure it's a blast but listen i sorta screwed up my knee yesterday
it's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer. one last speedstar.
so who uh who packed my chute.
you call him right now and tell him to let her go.
sure you can. you may even like it it's a killer rush. you'll see. hey don't i show you things johnny u.
but you're not alone.
you gotta tell me where she is.
no games bodhi. pull the cord. now.
you know less than nothing. if you even knew that you knew nothing at least that would be something but you don't.
how was the beach.
a little mushy.
yeah i get it. time to play let's dick the old guys huh harp.
yeah. what's your theory.
what you couldn't have just left the thing in your car.
the beaches are always being closed because of waste spills right. and surfers are territorial. they stick mostly to certain breaks. if we can get some hair samples and get a match to a certain beach we'd know which break the ex-presidents surf. you buyin' this.
got it.
the hell are they.
i mean what do you want. what are you doing hanging around here.
i need you to teach me.
nice place.
meaning you were expendable.
i i don't know. i can't describe what i'm feeling.
johnny what's going on. i don't get it did i do something.
betadyne doesn't hurt.
never saw him was your basic hit and run.
well i saw you and
major looks like there were ten maybe twelve guerrillas. looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper. then a different set of track over there.
i knew this man. green berets out of fort bragg. what the hell were they doing in here. you got any answers for this dillon.
because i told you you're the best. i knew you could do it but i couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
what story did you give to davis.
you saw what.
you lift off in three hours. there's one other thing.
well i might be going out to dinner.
i like your hat.
the real estate possibilities are endless. most of the yard we'll just level. i talked to a couple of developers under the table of course and they said 
what i did with those companies was perfectly legal.
the price just went up to ten.
no.
very good. you're obviously mechanical.
new york.
you like being a hooker vivian.
what's your name lover.
good morning.
where'd you go.
the one i'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
there see. now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
all right. how much for the week.
done.
know what we're gonna do in a little while then. we're gonna call domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza. we're gonna eat it in bed. we're gonna veg' out and watch television.
yeah it's this box it has pictures sound. you don't have to use your brain at all.
i still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
good.
no.
i've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but i've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
can we talk about this. can you just try to calm down.
i'm not hurt. it doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you it just pissed you off.
not all men hit. and no one is going to hit you anymore.
stay with me tonight. not because you're being paid to. stay with me because you want to.
vivian
you shouldn't go alone. he might claim that you tried to black mail him.
bill we're businessmen not the damn mafia. i'll see you in the office. by the way about your car
come on you can tell me. i sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
that crack is burning a hole in your pocket. there isn't even milk in the fridge. the rent's due. now come on 
in beverly hills.
kit
you think i fit here where they just about chew your food for you.
you're a guest here.
in fifteen minutes i can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the queen. first as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
but i always eat like this.
mr. harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
you're not accompanying him to new york.
i bet. a lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
i-would-not-say-such things-if- iwere-you-
you don't seem excited my little muffin.
you're the dread pirate roberts; admit it.
hear this now: i will come for you.
oh westley darling. westley why won't you hold me.
gently.
i got married. i didn't want to. it all happened so fast.
why is that do you think.
i thought i was going faster.
finish him finish him. your way.
he's with the prince in the castle. but the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
no not vizzini i need the man in black 
 where.
you've been mostly dead all day.
will this do.
you read that wrong. she doesn't marry humperdinck she marries westley. i'm just sure of it. after all that westley did for her if she does not marry him it wouldn't be fair.
westley's only faking right.
i don't understand.
ah but how will you capture us. we know the secrets of the fire swamp. we can live there quite happily for some time. so whenever you feel like dying feel free to visit.
a technicality that will shortly be remedied. but first things first. to the death.
who won. how did it end.
are you the miracle max who worked for the king all those years.
i hate waiting. i could give you my word as a spaniard.
you've done nothing but study swordplay.
i admit it you are better than i am.
who are you.
stop doing that. we can all relax it's almost over-
inhale this but do not touch.
wait till i get going. where was i.
he's afraid. ever since prince humperdinck fired him his confidence is shattered.
bye-bye boys.
think it'll work.
wait a minute. this is a very big decision. it might effect the course of my entire life. i'll have to think about it. i'll do it.
wait. this is boomerang. this is boomerang.
all right. get a hold of yourself. take a deep breath let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
go. you have fifty-eight seconds.
well sir it seems 
what is that. a handkerchief.
mr. bialystock 
this is hardly a time for levity. i've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
all right. i'll do it. i'll do it.
nothing. nothing. do it. do it.
now let's see two thousand dollars. that isn't much. i'm sure i can hide it somewhere. after all the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
you were saying that under the right circumstances a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
what do you mean.
you raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
what scheme. your scheme you bloody little genius.
you miserable cowardly wretched little caterpillar. don't you ever want to become a butterfly. don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory.
what's the matter leo. don't you like coney island.
i i love it. i haven't been there since i was a kid. but it's nearly two o'clock. i really should be getting back to whitehall and marks.
how do you do. have you gone mad. a receptionist that can't speak english. what will people say.
why. take it when you can get it. flaunt it baby flaunt it.
bloom bloom maybe it's not true.
i vas never a member of the nazi party. i am not responsible. i only followed orders. who are you.
i'm a yankee doodle dandy 
we swear it.
always.
now ve take the two fuse leads attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
here. you see. this is the slow fuse. it is much wider. it has more resistance more density. therefore it burns slower.
you mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on.
you blum go motel.
thursday. thursday. we'll play thursday. we'll play the contessa and the chauffeur.
oh the best one.
the blue max
lorenzo saint dubois. but everybody calls me lsd.
we won.
we have reason to believe she came this way might have stopped in this area did she stop here.
very early. dawn.
she didn't call anyone. even locally.
you didn't spend the whole night with her did you.
i live there. alone.
or if she had you say gallantly protecting her you wouldn't be fooled you'd know she was just using you. wouldn't you.
no. i told you she's confined
what's your interest.
she was seen leaving town in her car. seen by her very victims i might add.
sam they don't want to prosecute they just want the money back. it was all in cash
not even a hunch. just hope.
i'd really rather not. please. can't we just settle this and
yes.
forty thousand dollars.
please.
and you thought she'd come up here to me. if she had what reason would she have for not calling you.
why not. sam is she hiding here. are you two planning to go away with the money.
she'll need both of us.
where can i stay.
yes.
why can't i go out there with you.
does that mean we can't
no thank you. it's my problem too.
i won't feel satisfied unless i got out there sam.
sam if you owned a useless business like this motel one you probably couldn't even sell what would you need to get away to start a new business somewhere else. forty thousand dollars.
how could we prove well if he opens a new motel on the new highway say a year from now
sam.
where are you going. i don't mean to pry
i'm looking for a private island.
sometimes when she talks that way to me i'd like to curse her out and leave her forever. or at least defy her. but i couldn't. she's ill.
except you.
why don't you go away.
to a private island like you.
i'd like to but
then i'm free to go.
oh.
norman took a wife.
i suppose you want a cabin.
i'll get your bags.
i'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here i'm just doubting that you are. i think if you saw a chance to get out from under you'd unload this place
forty thousand dollars.
did i.
noi don't want to give any money. everybody wants moneyi'm not going to give any money.
why yes to you mr.mr. what.
that sounds to me very remarkable.
[lot of] how many cats you havewhat's the matter rats.
by the way where <u>is</u> your assistant.
oh just the basement. some day i intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. it will save me from intrusion.
take me down there.
it won't do any good. they are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
what is it now.
there's no child here and no dogs either.
i don't think you could have a real affair. you couldn't care for anyone.
you would.
ouch. eat. you can do a solo if you don't step on it. i'm going to bow out on you.
disappoint me. why what do you mean dear.
nonsense. she's one of the nicest girls i know.
you wouldn't have said that before you met her.
that's the way i feel about it.
and he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. let him think it was his fault he should be along very shortly . . but be very stern before you forgive him especially if it is your fault  while you're waiting for your friend would you like to see some new figures i have downstairs.
we have found immortality you and i. you must not be afraid.
great. consider yourself crippled financially. see if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
i'm through clowning. you're all washed up. get out.
that is none of our business. but you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti.
i wouldn't be trying beloved. i would hang him. and another thing all this gaga about the body disappearing. eight bodies have been stolen in new york within the last eighteen months. doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle.
and they never proved anything against him.
i asked you to keep your trap shut.
all right you poor baboon you can guess the rest of it.
listen stupid could i do anything that would possibly meet with your approval.
yes she committed suicide yesterday. that's not news. i heard about it last year.
no foolin' any suspect.
why would i string y'. they were sweeties until a month ago.
make it snappy colonel.
nix flo he won't let you in and you'll only get me in dutch.
yeah. i suppose you people will crucify me for something i didn't do. i didn't. you understand that. i didn't do it. she tried before 
not even then. the police are the proper people to conduct this affair. now if you've got any suspicions i'll drive you to the nearest police station.
but the composition as a whole i've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
i will only be gone about half an hour.
i'd be glad to mr. igor. i think i'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
two: what if i didn't miss.
you did miss 
why.
is rose here.
nobody.
why it has just made me ill buddy. i'm sick. i don't want to eat nothin' i don't and me i got a good appetite that ain't nat'ral for me. i'm ill.
no you can't. and i'll tell you this he scares me. as kind as he is he scares me. you can't fool around with him not with that man. and boy i sure better not try nothin' like that with him again he'll fire me.
there's an evil streak in everybody rose.
rose i have a serious favor to ask you.
no. no you're not hurting me. but i think you better quit it.
rose are you all right. are you sick or something.
rose they could stick splinters under my fingernails and i will never say a word. i will never tell them because i love you.
makin' homes for purple martins huh. we had 'em on the farm. they're the prettiest things. that's what i wish i was a bird. just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
of course not.
son was rose in your room last night.
what do you think brother.
but how would you find him.
well. well what i mean is you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. but look this brother it is even more interesting. look at this mark here and that mark over there. now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder.
in the kitchen drinking all the ice water in glenville. she walked out here she didn't go by the hotel.
now i have a plan about rose an educational plan. she's getting better and we don't want any more trouble  brother you ought to hear this.
he had his hand on her titty.
buddy i'm worried about rose.
it isn't that she hasn't got any sense doll. her basic intelligence is probably above average maybe quite a bit above average.
then why does she act so dumb.
it isn't yankee whisky daddy it's scotch.
what sad news. did her cancer come back.
yeah i know he was up here. it's pitiful like you say. when he lost rose it ruined the man it destroyed him totally when he lost rose.
i am afraid so son. about a week ago. her husband phoned me she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
well you have knocked me for a hell of a loop old man. a hell of a loop.
i asked you what you think of rosebud now that she's been here a while.
the girl worries me. if she walks down the street like that an army will be following her.
be kind to her. she loves you so much. in a perfectly proper way of course.
quarter of twelve.
 i am not responsible for her epizootics and i did not bring about her epizootics. now listen to me. when i have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes 
you're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. the problem is what are we going to do.
i'd say about three months. are you satisfied.
rose isn't oversexed that's ridiculous. if you're going to talk nonsense i don't want to talk to you at all. rose is exactly the same as the rest of us except more so.
honey he is mr. right.
yes sir.
rosebird baby you are the light of my life darlin'. how did we ever get by without you.
how can the buttons stand the pressure.
what have you got in your hair girl.
yes mr. hillyer it was. i i heard strange voices in the night.
strange voices rose.
boy for four or five days there i didn't think i'd live. but i'm my old self again.
i didn't mean to bite him. he was hitting horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and and i bit him accidental.
i mean a human investment rose we care about you you matter to us. but we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. do you hear me.
what's the use there ain't none.
god forbid. you're not sick rose forget it. don't get any notions in your head you're not sick.
tennessee.
yes tennessee a lovely state.
your baby.
all right tell us rose what makes you think you're pregnant.
it's so mr. hillyer.
i don't want to start no fight with you buddy. why do you say i'm full of shit.
she used to call me mr. right. remember that buddy.
what do you want me to tell her dave.
she looks terrible just awful.
a tenant farm. are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt.
illusions madam.
i will not cry like a woman. if i'm upset it's because of what my husband said not because of you. you can't make me cry like a woman a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. and you get this in your head. if you hurt that girl i'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got i'll do my level best to ruin you. do you understand me.
it must be wonderful to be so smart. i don't see how you do it reading all those books learning all that stuff.
well i think it's charming rose. but don't you think ah the skirt is a little tight.
ohh-hh a little. oh-h i ain't never been to no dentist before. he's gonna kill me i just know it.
don't worry honey you'll find something.
how much.
i figure for this information the usual payment times ten.

three hundred kilos of white lady hidden inside a giant bust of abraham lincoln. a parade float.

what about jack daniels. wasn't he a decorated general in the civil war.
general jim beam then.
there probably is.
he tried to kill us.
you can't be serious.
well shake a leg. get these files downstairs and quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
no. don't open your mouth. you <u>honestly</u> think you can explain this to my satisfaction.
you're about an inch away from insubordination.
just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club doesn't make you any less a murderer.
your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
second of all the declaration of independence was all for liberty and equality but it didn't do anything about slavery did it.
what . not you too.
i can't believe i'm hearing this
yeah my arms healed up real good and that's how i wanna keep 'em. that's what i'm trying to tell you.
if it is that's pretty high up on the totem pole. what do you think.

the champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly creed snaps out a triple combination that backs balboa into a corner oh a solid hook by creed a master of fist-men.
without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl i have ever seen the ringside audience is spotted with blood. this fight should have been stopped rounds ago but rocky balboa refuses to fall 
that's it. completely.
excuse me.
absolutely sparrin' with the champ would be an honor y'know what.

yo rock. i made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man thatta dog.

the rabbit's wife. wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you.
yes we talked to mr. maroon. he told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back. is that true.
being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective. what were you looking for mr. valiant.
they must've taken it off me.
earl it's me valiant.
toon cops worked me over.
so altruistic.
cause i don't take acme dumb pills. i don't know what you're up to lady but i'm gonna nail you for the acme murder.
looks like our goose is cooked our hash is slung our fait is accompli
lemme guess where you got that from. tell me somethin' what'd you ever see in that guy anyway.
i got him on loan from disney.
maybe. why.
meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. if you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
you're not too good at this are you r.k.
what the hell are you doin'.
so i hear. even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
my philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor you're better off dead.
why you crazy toon i've been out there riskin' my neck for you.  i come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
but that's my calling my purpose my raison d'etre. toons are supposed to make people laugh and believe me those people needed a laugh.
an arsonist and a kidnapper. he just got outta prison.
here you go kid say hi to casper for me.
you wanna know. well since you're so goddamn curious i'll tell ya. one of you toons killed my brother.
yeah.
and i'm glad you got your sense of humor back. think you'll keep it.
then i defy you stars. juliet. juliet. i will hence tonight.
but alas poor romeo. he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter tybalt.
not having that which having makes them short.
tell me in sadness who is that you love.
a right good marks-man. and she's fair i love.
content thee gentle cuz content thee. let him alone; i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement: therefore be patient take no note of him
uncle 'tis a shame.
my poverty but not my will consents.
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise and with this i'll help it presently.
rosaline. my ghostly father no; i have forgot that name and that name's woe.
i pray thee chde me not; whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
madam in happy time what day is that.
what. now. st. peter's church and peter too he shall not make me there a joyful bride.
what daughter are you busy. need you my help.
no madam. we have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you let me now be left alone and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for i am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
goodnight.
good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much which mannerly devotion shows in this; for saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
then move not while my prayer's effect i take. thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged.
'tis but thy name that is my enemy; thou art thyself though not a montague. what's montague. it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any other part belonging to a man. o be some other name. what's in a name. that which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet; so romeo would were he not romeo call'd retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title. o romeo doff thy name and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself.
do not swear at all; or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self which is the god of my idolatry and i'll believe thee.
a thousand times the worse to want thy light. love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books but love from love toward school with heavy looks.
by the hour of nine.
come gentle night. come loving black-browned night give me my romeo. and when i shall die take him and cut him out into little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. o i have bought the mansion of love but not possessed and though i am sold not yet enjoyed. o tedious is this day as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er i nursed.
well what was yours.
o then i see queen mab hath been with you. she is the fairies' midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate-stone on the fore-finger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies over men's noses as they lie asleep; her chariot is an empty hazel-nut her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers' brains and then they dream of love; o'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream on fees sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again. this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage: this is shethis is she.
good morrow to you both. what counterfeit did i give you.
a most courteous exposition.
follow me close. gentlemen gooday. a word with one of you.
you shall find me apt enough to that sir. and you will give me occasion.
calm dishonorable vile submission. thou art my souls hate. tybalt. you ratcatcher will you walk.
what wouldst thou have with me.
do you have it.
do you really think so.
it's under your seat.
coordinate all you want but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me. are we in sync on this vincent.
finding this package is a thing easier said than done. we don't even know what it is. what did we steal.
i drive and my name is larry. larry from the states.
from interpol.
i feel as if i've wandered onto the set of enter the dragon. could you teach me to do that.
nobody's saying they don't.
check this out. gregor's a spook or he was one until recently. when he was a spy he lived the life you know a prince in some eastern bloc country where nobody had shit and gregor had everything. then the wall goes down. no more cold war. and gregor is out of a job. no apartment no special stores with western food and video tapes. i would bet dollars against shit that gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up. and i wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think
i intend to. this phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand. with my custom hardware and this phone i can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes
but would you stake your life that's the question
that fucking figures
i'm sure. but i'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
he's company.
bad company
i'm shocked shocked to think that you'd believe him.
i'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money the least you could do is have the decency to pay me.
really.
i've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through. he's a cop.
what are you gonna do call him up and ask him to give us back our shit.
eat shit and die slowly
what makes you think we're here to meet you.
coordinate what.
to see a man about a thing.
i didn't know that you spoke french.
what's the difference.
i just wanted to see something.
you know what you pulled back there that was bullshit.
that there was a gun pointed at me.
fix it yourself. why are we even doing this. there's no need to run christ you're a cop.
i'm going with you.
you see the bullet.
clearly.
i'm a field agent last of an already extinct breed. i do dark ops.
it's the one thing i've got left to hold onto. jean-pierre is one of your closest friends is he not.
and yet you would have killed him to save my life. you have a sense of honor vincent that i can't even remember anymore. i don't know that i ever even had it to begin with. all i know to do vincent is to finish my job.
you sure.
a friend. i was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
i gotta try and overcharge him he has to moan about the price we settle somewhere in the middle.
i'd like to know what they were doing in my town. did you get id off any of them.

he would have won more but he blew it at the end. didn't know what cash and carry was.
look around you partner. you said yourself you never saw anything like it.
it won't work.
i told trudy we were coming down this way that's why.

you shut up this is the most fucked up mission i ever heard of. goddamned ryan fuck the little bastard.
captain my feet are most uncomfortable. if i'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to ramelle i never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
i'd love to hear it.
watching.
i'm in my backyard lying in my hammock with my arm around my wife listening for the sound of breaking glass.
upham.
pass.
would they notice and eighty-eight.
he's right captain it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
nope.
shoves the needle into wade's neck. thick vein. pumps the morphine straight to wade's brain. motions impatiently to sarge.
no problem. a pair of deuces. less. so what. i bluff. it used to tear me apart when i'd get one of my men killed but what was i supposed to do. break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do. of course not so i bluffed and after a while i started to fall for my own bluff. it was great it made everything so much easier. sarge is that why your hand's been shaking.
it could be worse. you know the first thing they teach you at o.c.s. lie to your men.
no i'm not kaback is honest. or what about faulkner. or that little guy with the glasses.
captain can i ask you a question.
sir you know what ramelle is famous for. cheese. the rest of the company is going to caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of france. there is no bright side.
reiben what's the matter with you. i don't gripe to you. i'm a captain. there's a chain of command. griping goes one way up only up never down. you gripe to me i gripe to my superior officers. up get it. i don't gripe to you i don't gripe in front of you. how long you been in the army.
i thought you said we had an hour sir.
thank you sir.
don't do that again.
upham. good kid smart he was writing a book.
fine you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned private james ryan can carry my fucking gear.
shit sir.
i usually like surprises.
i'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that i worked for my entire life. i don't even care. i met this boy over the summer and i i can't see him because of this i can't talk to him i can't talk to my father about i wore these clothes i thought i thought that if i looked right and if i acted right then someone would talk to me. but i look awful and i feel awful could you could you please talk to me. be a little decent.
so you refuse to answer my questions.
why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise.
it's no problem. i called mom and dad in germany; it's like they were there.
how do you know how to draw the red line anyway.
why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate.
gee it's easy.
please.
did you sleep with her.
lloyd listen to me. everything has changed. you've had sex. no matter what you might think nothing will ever be the same between you two. you might be sixty. you might be walking down the street and you'll talk to her about something whatever. but what you'll really be thinking is 'we had sex'.
having taken a few courses at the university this year i have glimpsed our future and all i can say is go back.
they really applauded you today honey.
i love you dad.
dad.
dad i'm sorry.
i was irresponsible i should have called.

you're going.
dad in a million years i would never give him a pen. what's wrong with having some fun. i like him.
sweetheart no. don't be ridiculous.
i swear to god.
you think you know what this money is.

no. i told you everything you lied to me. i would have done anything for you.
whoah what a day huh.
busy.
yeah i have to judge who can drive home and who can't. i have to keep their keys.
yeah but that's an old story you don't want to hear it.
twisted.
yeah.
you think so.
i usually have a break after the dinner service if you want to stop by.
i think that's ageism and that's that's being prejudiced against people because they're old. maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
yeah.
i don't think i am.
check your mail tomorrow. i sent you a letter a letter.
i know. lloyd let's not start putting things on this level.
i feel like a dick. you must think i'm a dick.
no.
lloyd i love you okay.
then don't do it.
i love you.
you're freaking out here man.
why don't i just get your phone number that's usually how it works.

you know what you'd like her.
oskar please -
luck.
yeah what's that.
if you admit to making three then it's four actually. but how.

ghetto police. i'm a policeman now can you believe it.
i work hard for you. i'll continue to work hard for you.
like this.
the place produces nothing. i shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the army. that's not all right.

christmas presents.

the way i see it. we’ll be arrested. go to prison. cash in on the home footage. secure a book deal. if all goes as planned our trial should coincide with the release of stab ii.
we had to have financing.
i've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned
and an explanation is of course out of the question.
i'm sorry. i don't know what else to say except i'm sorry.
a bloody knife. a ghost mask. something like that.
and it's sexier in the dark.
maybe not. but think about the sex. as frustrated as i am
three hundred people watched. nobody did anything.
no gale i'm just getting started. seeya soon.
i'm okay. people magazine won't stop calling but other than that
.we only promote safe rubbered sex.
what do you care. let 'em have their fun. so what's up.
i'm sorry i'm sorry but i had to. it was too easy.
i just have a hard time with insipid sexist violence.
i'm sorry sid please. i never should have gone along with gale. i know i'm stupid. i wish i had some good reason to give you but i'm just stupid. please sid don't be mad at me.

no they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business. i grew up here and i know my way around the studios.
must be exciting beautiful place beautiful people.
hmm.
i used to think i had the perfect mom perfect family. till i found out i was wrong. she had a secret life and i tried to understand that and soon as i thought i had more secrets. i don't' know who my mom was. sometimes i feel like i'm just learning about my mother for the first time. you know with tv and those movies and what not. god sometimes i feel like i'm just learning about myself for the first time. like i'm watching my life instead of living in it.
before you jump to conclusions the man in the picture cotton weary is out of the country on business. his alibi checks out. seems he's got a tv show in australia 100% cotton. it's supposedly the biggest thing down under since yahoo serious but that's besides the point.
is that a threat detective.
where are you dewey.
why would the police come to you.
it was fucking '60 minutes ii'. i couldn't say no. i could've been the next diane sawyer.
it didn't work dewey. we tried we're different.
dewey you're not just here because of that second rate k-mart straight-to-video version of me are you.
the boys said no. she wouldn't give her name. a month later the station gets broken into the file room ransacked.
what part of 'off the record' don't you understand.
dewey what the hell is she rambling about now. what's wrong jen see yourself on one of those usa network winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting.
listen you sick bastard what the fuck do you want.
ha. maybe i should join snl.
oh come on. why the hostility.
gale he's got dewey.
w-what do you want.
you sick fuck i'm tracing this call as we speak. the police are gonna nail your ass.
let them try. you'll never find me. i've already gotten away with murder before. for instance maureen prescott.
if you lay a hand on him i'll fucking kill you.
you're doing real good. can't you figure it out. i wanna finish this where it all began. woodsboro.
alright i'm here now show your face so we can finish this.
hello.
thanks butt wart. you did good.
duh that's quick.
dude. what are you doing here.
tell that to cotton weary. you wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
billy. what the
close call.
jesus shit.
so
yeah and when i called no one answered.
i thought you were
no. don't believe him.
you bitch where the fuck are you.
why don't you want to talk to me.
you getting scared.
i'm telling you the truth. i lied before
so you better leave.
please don't hurt him.
no
then he dies. right now.
nooo.
please
i'm sorry. that's the wrong answer.
you tricked me
what door am i at.
if you'll excuse me ma'am.
deputy good evening.
not much story here. just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
what kind of lead.
have they found my father.
we got him sheriff. billy loomis.
what's the plan.
about thirty seconds.
during the trial you did all those stories about me. you called me a liar.
i think you falsely identified him. yes.
poor billy-boyfriend. an innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
no you didn't.
no. oh well i'm hitting the sack. my flight leaves first thing in the morning. now the expo runs all weekend so i won't be back til sunday. there's cash on the table and i'll be staying at the raleigh hilton
besides  takes a man to do something like that.
because he's probably dead. his body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere eyes gauged. see the police are always off track with this shit if they'd watch prom night they'd save time. there's formula to it. a very simple one. everyone's always a suspect the father the principal the town derelict
why are they doing this.
why are you doing this.
the official term is psychotic.
no way.
tell your mom i said thanks.
it's past seven.
you can't prove a rumor. that's why it's a rumor.
and you believe it.
you know if i were accused of carving up two people i'd take the opportunity to skip school.
that's mature.
i got it. tatum get me a beer. they're in the fridge in the garage.
he cuts off the skin if his fingertips. that's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment. he's been doing it for quite a while. keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
you don't. it goes to court now.
what do you think.
announcing what.
hey so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins. but this was a fat guy. the killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. and writing on the walls happens all the time. it's like the fashionable thing to do.
well there he sits. it's not supposed to make sense.
who tied her down. you or him.
what do you mean.
what's so exciting.
what time is it.
i i doubt i enjoyed it any more than detective mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows. isn't that true. how happy would it make you to hurt me with impunity.
now i wouldn't do something like that johnny. i like you. i like you a lot.
i wish i could have been a normal man like you. i wish i could have a simple life.
here he comes.
this is his stuff. i've been out in the cold all day.
it's too soon for him.
all television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
the sins were used in medieval sermons. there were seven cardinal virtues and then seven deadly sins created as a learning tool because they distract from true worship.
nothing.
it doesn't fit. he doesn't want us to help him stop.
you meant what you said to mrs. gould didn't you. about catching this guy. you really want to believe that don't you.
we put it in a nice neat pile and file it away on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom. it's like collecting diamonds on a desert island. you keep them just in case you ever get rescued but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
he doesn't have the desire somehow. our killer seems to have more purpose. more purpose than victor could ever conceive of.
yes. they were there so it must be.
never in my twenty-four years knock on wood. i've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it. never fired it though. not once. you.
we have to divorce ourselves from emotions here. no matter how hard it is we have to stay focused on the details.
they pay cops for the inside scoop and they pay well.
i'm sick of sitting around waiting for him to kill again.
if you want to know who's been reading paradise lost purgatory and say the life and time of charlie manson the bureau's computer will tell you. it might give us a name.
that is.
by the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
where's the victory.
i'm sorry about this mrs. gould. i really am.
it's nice to meet you. my husband has told me a lot about you except your first name.
i hear you and mills were high school sweethearts.

it's about me and david.
you mustn't take it so badly.
can you afford this place.
yes.
look it's a fairly straightforward question. you're either divorced or you're not.
it's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is quite simply just that.

stay stay away.
wendy
give me the bat.
only in a very general way.
well
the winters can be fantastically cruel and the basic idea is toto cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur. and this consists mainly of running the boiler heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs so that the elements can't get a foothold.
we can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
by five o'clock tonight you'll never know anybody was ever here.
jack is going to take care of the overlook for this winter. i would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
fine.
i used to see her every day and she never knew what was going to happen to her and neither did i. i mean i know how stupid that sounds but
rattling. rustling.
you all right marty.
there's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. you ever hear that one.
it's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. not bad huh. i read sherwood anderson in college. i can jive that shit all day.
i don't get you.
what is it.
thanks a million uncle al.
i'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. and i'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to mr. haller.

your superiors are two days away.
no. you will not run me out. no one will believe a word of what you say.
i have everything last testaments birth certificates death certificates deeds.

and now jonathan masbath.
i deserve to help you. don't you see how much this means. my father he he was a good man

i was getting worried. who was it.
lady van tassel.

mustard's good on 'em to me.
frank he went off too. he ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
i's horned and raised here up till i's twelve year old.
yes sir.
not funny ha ha funny queer.
well that's a very offensive way to put it. you shouldn't say that. you were taught that weren't you.
i was thinkin' i could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
oh. how about before that.
that dern doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. will you give me your word you'll do it.
what about you karl. do you want to stay here.
are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy.
frank's just crazy about him. he likes the way he talks. he helped him carry home the clean laundry.
i don't know why you're so weirded out this is not san quentin it's just a nuthouse. most of these people don't even know where they are they're not gonna hurt you.
how am i going to conduct an interview if i can't ask him any questions.
where will he go.
you mean about y'all bein' together in that way.
yes.
it's just a summer job. something to help pay the bills while i finish my dissertation.
what happened.
are you closed.
you run out of schimmelpennincks.
that's right. more than four thousand pictures of the same place. the corner of 3rd street and seventh avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather. that's why i can never take a vacation. i've got to be in my spot every morning. every morning in the same spot at the same time.
it's kind of overwhelming.
so what brings you to a dive like this.
he's crazy.
so what did he say when he called.
fine. or it was until a couple of days ago. a guy from the new york times called and asked me to write a christmas story. they want to publish it on christmas day.
anything good.
every word.
she probably died.
i guess so. i never thought of it that way.
it was a good deed auggie. it was a nice thing you did for her.
anything for art eh paul.
i don't want to talk about it. if you really want to know. i lost it. and i'm not sorry i did. that eye was cursed auggie and it never gave me nothing but grief.
and you think it looks better to go around dressed up like captain hook.
stop it already. just stop all this crap right now. was that your idea to call her felicity.
you've suckered me before darling remember. why should i believe you now.
you're conning me sweetheart. i ain't responsible for no baby.
then why do you think i married frank. i was already pregnant and i didn't have much time. say what you like but at least he gave my kid a name.
i thought i could handle it. i didn't want to bug you. i thought i could handle it on my own but i couldn't. she's in real bad auggie.
that i wasn't bullshitting you sweetheart. at least you'll know i've been telling the truth.
still you can't just write her off.
for keeps.
i should stop smoking these damn things is what i should do. the fuckers are going to kill me one day.
no it's five thousand dollars.
and why the hell would you give me money.
does it hurt.
and these.
he goes to john jay high school in brooklyn.
and.
i don't know. i haven't decided yet.
once you look at it you're going to want to buy it from me. that's guaranteed. and that's the price: five bucks. so if you're not willing to spring for it you might as well not bother to look. it'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
and have you mended them.
well you and junior have the same name too don't you.
paul. rashid. thomas. which one is it.
okay joke about it. i don't give a shit.
watch out man. you'll get yourself killed like that.
no wait. you can't just walk off. you saved my life.
that's all right. if i think of something i'll send my butler over to tell you.
come on. at least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
mostly what.
of course. where else.
that's where the what comes in.
except that there's no bed is there. and no breakfast either.
i wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
what time did you get to bed last night.
once a story gets hold of you it's hard to let go. besides i'm making up for lost time.
that's logical. and if you don't sleep you don't need a bed. saves you money too. so what's this story you're working on anyway.
is it yours.
so you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
seven acres. i'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em. just curious is all.
second question. what did ole jurgensen pay you per acre.
now the sheriff believed that the d-6 battery in carl's well was carl's own spare. even though it was too large f
i told myself that was good. that it made our friendship special. and didn't mean she was ashamed of it. necessarily.
your friends would. your dad would kill me with a machete.
i couldn't say anything. i just stood there hating her.
i did. but the jury won't s
your father fought at belleau wood it took him years to get over it. nightmares tears b
they were japanese-american boys yes sir.
and the next one.
well the freighter. the twine. the blood. the knife. the cup. the watch. the second battery. the phantom lantern. the fishing gaff. the cracked gunnel. the skull wound. the blond hair. that's <u>eleven</u> things
you said three minutes.
he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there. so he climbs up. to cut it down.
maybe carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio which is now working. same report milholland heard. and <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast. before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
if i whistle. those boys'll see you and come runnin'. <u>you're</u> the story today.
naw i had that around for a while.
i told your wife. trials aren't always so much about actual truth. as about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. that's sad. and it's real.
maybe the assailant straightened the cabin. and forgot the cup.
i think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on. cabin mast net lights picking lights
is it possible his head struck the transom or the stern gunnel or the net roller as you were bringing him in.
operating this winch you'd rarely operated before doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 poundsis it <u>possible</u>. possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. possible.
she's alright nels thanks for asking.
well he didn't say 'no' did he. didn't say no hope existed.
the sweep is just routine not even police action. i'd like to see some sort ofmeaningful evidence
melton on the double. up a chain.                  melton sir.   melton takes a few easy strides gracefully catches a chain mid- stride and smarts up climbing easily and twice as fast as todd.   church sloan and rubrick crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.   three quarters of the way up melton comes even with todd then passes him. mekum watching smirks.   church is watching too and he's still not satisfied. his brow is knit something's bothering him.   angle high above among the girders   stonefaced melton is resting an a platform on the chain sixty feet up beneath the girders swaying gently.   his stony gaze is on the next chain where todd is arriving at a platform on an adjacent chainonly three feet away.   their eyes meet todd and melton alone together sixty feet up three feet apart. neither man blinks neither man flinches neither man reveals anything at all   low angle looking up   church considers the men high above then to mekum.                  church          what aboutspirit.

first thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on greased lightning.
what are you giving me with the rabbit.
but suppose he loses.
sam the bookie. nothing doing. you're not putting my overcoat on that dog.
but we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
all the way to urbana - for a one night stand.
they got the bull-fiddle.
you going to call the police.
not there - that's the emergency brake.
now you've done it.
you'd better go fix it.
look - no butter no pastry and no sugar.
fight it.
what's going on here. daphne - daphne -
blow where.
we can get a job with another band. a male band.
what is it young lady. what are you staring at.
wise guy huh. trying to louse me up -
come on you can do better than that. give him teeth - the whole personality.
i'm engaged.
why not. he keeps marrying girls all the time.
look stop treating me like a child. i'm not stupid. i know there's a problem.
like right after the ceremony.
then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - i'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
look jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy.
that's some nerve.
get me room 414.
tell him you're going to elope with him.
if there's anything i can do for you -
i'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
anything wrong.
i'm fine.

i'm a what.
oh please do come. don't disappoint us. it'll be such fun. and bring your yacht.
well i'll be - .  how about that guy.
sugar dear - let me give you some advice. if i were a girl - and i am - i'd watch my step.
he's going to south america to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
wanna bet.
my last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - zowie. - but mama broke it up.
i'll throw up.
who.
about that roadhouse -
it's not the backs that worry me.
i used to sing with male bands. but i can't afford it any more.
have you ever been with a male band.
yeah.
men.
about the future. you know - like a husband. that's why i'm glad we're going to florida.
going to catch yourself a rich bird.
i might as well stay in there. i won't be able to sleep anyway.
forget it sugar will you. forget about saxophone players. you're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
my fault.
because usually when people find out who i am they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
haven't i seen you somewhere before.
syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz.
so do i. as a matter of fact i spent three years at the sheboygan conservatory of music.

orange whip nectar of the bowling gods. thanks sweetie. millie turns the tray so that buzz takes the untainted whip. theo takes the other glass.
who gave it to you.
you're a bullshit artist that's what you are. you got no right to be here. theo yanks the trophy away from buzz.
it's the next level the next dimension the small ball.
i was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. the moment passes. theo turns and climbs into his car. he looks up at buzz.
we ain't married no more.
what about bowling.
he's the guy buzz.
he's not the guy millie. just whip the whips.
son.
it depends.
buzz fazeli.

norman get out of there now. norman.
to the craft. none. not a scratch.
right. so you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch.
i don't know how it can be chipped but it's chipped.
it could. but the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
who is that. where's that coming from.
are you enjoying yourself harry because i don't know what the hell you're doing.
what <u>about</u> a crowbar.
look at this.
time travel. i always thought it was one of those myths like santa's reindeer.
sir about leaving 
well until we know exactly what it is nobody goes outside understood.
resetting the sub.
that's quite a secret.
the timing has never seemed quite right.
wait a minute.
yeah why.
i can't feel her bones. she's like a sponge.
c'mon beth. don't make this personal. he told me himself they were taking us back.
yeah he <u>told</u> you. think. what was barnes doing before they cut that cable loose. he was on the phone. except that cable is a thousand feet long norman. they would've broken off communication with us four five minutes before they cleared out.
beth 
you did didn't you.
you bastard.
we can't. the storm. the waves would toss us around worse than we got down here. and we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
yes norman. i did. you're just nervous.

but 
and the snakes. you want to know about the snakes. you saw one outside earlier didn't you. when you thought i had deserted you you were terrified.
one lonely terrifying sea snake.
that's bullshit.
don't beth.
it's your choice. because it's not safe for you to be awake. to be walking around. to be thinking about things.
would it work.
all that banging and pounding. i don't know. we should think about making a good first impression.
what are you looking for.
just in time too.
why are you looking at me like that.
don't be defensive.
go ahead. ladies first.
c'mon.
getting anywhere with those.
thank you. my suit beth said she fixed it 
wisconsin.

meaning.
it didn't fly here. it <u>arrived</u> here.
beth and harry.
what was that sir.
no other equipment. scientific instruments.
you've heard of me.
you mean a picture.
i don't see anything.
well he's polite.
i don't know.
how much do you think she's talking about.
luke's got a point fear is their greatest defense i doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on aquilae or sullust and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
oh so you're a warrior then.
i assure you my intentions weren't bad.
i know your intentions. i probably know much more about you than you realize. in many ways you're a lot like your father. he was an indulgent man but a clever warrior. now what brings you out here.

you go after the princess. i am an old man and would be of little help. i must try to find the crystal.
that's no battle kid they're just sitting there.
the plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness which we will determine from the data i stored in artoo.
you can't. we've come this far. we must find them
you're a good pilot i've learned a lot from you i wish you
you'll get no information from me. you have no authority the council can't hold me.
let him have it. you're winning anyway. it doesn't make any difference.
do you freely admit to the charges made against you .
oh yes sir. vector .

the difference lies in the field of civic virtue. a citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic of which he is a member defending it if need be with his life. the civilian does not.

that's precisely the point captain. we don't know it will do. moving into the cloud at this time is an unwarranted gamble.
how do you define <u>unwarranted</u> <u>mister</u>.
why bring us inside. not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
captain we can't be sure that our move will actually save earth.

hey you want to hear my short story now.
well i changed the ending a little.
you've lost interestyou hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
that's not fair. i was honest. just because i wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch catherine.

ok.
i don't think there's any hope either. i was just trying to make you feel better.
yeah. sure go ahead. hypnotize me.

oh i don't remember that
ok. bye.
thanks.

uh-oh. do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point or does washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games.
what are you going to do cooper throw yourself on a bunsen burner. it's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab. we'll be out in no time.
he's a very stubborn man sometimes
cooper
you're a lot like my father cooper you think with your heart.
what about rule one: never let the person you are protecting out of your sight.
looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all
we're on sublevel six. we'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell
go fuck yourself
good.
who's ryan cooper.
agreedlet's move it.
dissent.
get your men to do it.
don't be ridiculous.
goodbye mister ambassador.
naturally. it would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country. but this way we know it's safe and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
please mister president i am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation. here is the only other camera i have left.
now snap out of it fella.
look colonel. maybe it's too late. maybe they've sent air command in already. but we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
general schmuck.
as soon as you've done that shut down the communications center. lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
now as soon as you've done that double- up on all base security teams. our enemies are plenty smart and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
what's the gun for general ripper.
you know the regulations well major.
i know so major. i know so. and add to that the whole air command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
i'll tell you what i do think. if they say they're for disarmament i say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
i presume the planes are armed.
i'm afraid so mister presient. being part of the air-borne alert each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
how soon until the enemy finds out what's going on.
mister president i know you think i've let you down but we had to have a plan-r. if we completely centralized the command and control all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the capitol and we'd be out of business. we'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
well sir it looks like one aircraft the leper colony failed to receive the recall.
have you tried the recall again.
we should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
they must have clobbered some of our cities already.
a through h is correct.
check.
come on quentin isn't that pretty selfish putting yourself ahead of the mission.
where'd they get you.
release first safety.
everything still checks out okay.
yes major.
i bit his jugular vein. now will you shut up and get up here
no look. it's ope - recall mistake.
like hell it does.
it's me - lothar. are you okay.
we are.
i don't anymore.
you know one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
slides go with it.

the one danger we have considered is that the phantom zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. i cannot say i am glad you asked me that -
oh my fullness as i explained to you before i am about the best there is. second best there is.
you said it. three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
i'm the man they're 	protecting. i'm the president. i'll kneel before you if it will save lives.

it's just a bad flu really. how did you know . . .
of course it is. do you know what the sun is. why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. a bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like that.
but you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. you can't see any borders. it's just one world.
daddy .
yes darling.
gee uncle lex i was just getting to the good part.
hey. he looks normal.
ahhhh my favorite part of the day. who else could have thought of this aquarium.

mirrors then. it's done with mirrors.
what'd you call him.
bet he makes it.
some people can read 'war and peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe. y'know.
what do you suggest my dear.
she knows. clever very clever. and unappreciated. but i'm going to take you away from all this.
what if he doesn't show up. what if he's taking a nap.
i mean the other one.
this discussion is terminated. the decision of the council is final. you will cease pursuing this matter. any attempt by you to continue to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace will be deemed an act of insurrection.

.to feel yourself. very well. you are revealed to the world. but still you must keep your secret identity. first of all you will need it as an escape valve. you cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
or twenty-four as it is in earth time. furthermore if you will reveal yourself your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for. ah this earththis world you live in kal-el resist its temptations its rewards especially its political system.
lois the kickback story
nine to five it's a pulitzer prize i know.

what happened to summer.

what do you want me to do zoe. i'll do whatever you want.
i'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this mrs. otto but the walkers said you would understand. i know it's an awful time but it's important that we talk.
you can't come here.
so you're just the thing we need.
if you agree to have me represent you in this suit i will require no payment until after the case is won when i will require one third of the awarded amount. if there is no award made then my services will cost you nothing. it's a standard agreement.
been drinking since high school. fucked himself up. used to be smart enough.

the speedometer. and it was downhill there.
i was scared. and there wasn't time.
how do you like it nicole.

if looks could kill i'm dead
not being partial are you.
susie i'm sorry if-
hello harry.
correct me if i'm wrong - we. because when i'm out on this very slippery limb for you you have to know what's involved.
i'll do it j.j. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny in for a pound. i'll see it through but stop beating me around the head. let me make a living.
i know steve. no.
susie i like this new attitude of yours. you're growing up and i like it. i don't like it when you're limp and dependent when you're odd and wayward. this gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world. because don't forget dear you won't always have me with you will you.
full of beans ain't you. but you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now
could this be that boy.
what's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates.
i've been up to here. listen honey tell me something. you know susan hunsecker. has she been in. i mean lately in the last coupla days.
cigarette girls and naturally -
this sort of thing.
but what.
i know you do sidney.
why me.
dallas ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - hunsecker and elwell are enemies to the knife. so how do you get him doing j.j. a favor.
like you.
i know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength. so what do you pick such weak sisters for. don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire not with tear drops.
and on monday i'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
hello steve. i'm glad you could come.
miles it's sunday. you promised to take the kids to raging waters today.
but i thought aren't we changing things. i mean right now. changing the way it goes.
yes. cyberdyne systems model 101.
so this other guy. he's a terminator too right like you.
we spent a lot of time in nicaragua places like that. for a while she was with this crazy ex-green beret guy running guns. then there were some other guys. she'd shack up with anybody she could learn from. so then she could teach me how to be this great military leader. then she gets busted and it's like sorry kid your mom's a psycho. didn't you know. it's like everything i'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy right. i hated her for that. but everything she said was true. we gotta get her out of there.
typically the subject being copied is terminated.
we're not gonna make it are we. people i mean.
why do you cry.
pain causes it.
i'm sorry john.
it john. not him. it.
we're better off by ourselves.
i love you john. i always have.
 it's like a giant strobe light burning right through my eyes but somehow i can still see. look you know the dream's the same every night why do i have to 
i guess it's possible.
you have a question for helmuth david.
and totally irrelevant.
a human being oh good i'm relieved i thought you were going to say you were a music lover. this man this great artist has made anti-semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. i got letters.
yes.
says here because of your father. what's that mean.
oh yes major i have recordings of all his symphonies. i kept them safe during the bombing. my favourite is the seventh symphony.
no. ours was damaged.
how come.
your guess is as good as mine.
i need to work. i need to make my living. i live off the generosity of friends
and what was that.
yes i know who he is.
he said 'don't mind him. his job is to criticise your job is to conduct.'
and what happened to von der nul.
i'm sorry.
come on admit it. k worried you didn't he. he always worried you. in 1942 he's thirty-four years old you're already fifty-six. and goebbels and goering keep saying to you 'if you don't do it little k will.' never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty humanity and justice because i don't care how great you are. it's the oldest story in the book the ageing romeo jealous of the young buck. the real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that once you were out of the way you'd be supplanted by the miracle kid the party's boy twice over flashy talented little k.
well i'm just beginning to develop my theme. isn't that what you call it in classical music developing your theme. okay so they played on your insecurity. that's human understandable. but there is one guy who doesn't like little k as much as he likes you - yeah the number one man your old pal adolf. he thinks you're the greatest and when he says i want wilhelm for my birthday boy they better go out get wilhelm. so josef calls and threatens you with little k. and you said to hell with the ninth in vienna i'll give it to adolf as a birthday present in berlin. that's the trick they played they got you by the balls and they squeezed. hard. why did you stay. why did you play for them. why were you the flag-carrier for their regime. jealousy.
i have illegitimate children.
what.
stop this please stop this now.
those attitudes do not exist in me.
bruckner's seventh. the adagio.
i love my country i believe in music what was i to do.
the one he kept in his right hand. yes you remember.
show me.
not here major there are people if anybody should see please please major
oh i see he made you co-operate. and now are you a communist again.
there's a rumour i don't know if it's true or not but ask him about von der null.
edwin von der null. music critic. he gave furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about herbert von karajan.
and ask him about his private life.
aren't i worth waiting for.
can you handle it.
didn't see the war. i was born after in the ruins. grew up there. starving. hiding from the h-k's.
kyle.
kyle what's it like when you go through time.
i caught one back there.
this is gonna make me puke. talk about something.
what's he like.
stop. i don't want to know. hold still. soit was john that ordered you here.
you'll learn.
okay. talk some more.
reese. think it through. we can prevent the war. nobody else is gonna do it. if we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again. we have to so it ourselves.
is this enough.
hot dogs.
it'll never be over will it. look at me i'm shaking. some legend huh. you must be pretty disappointed.
good fighters.
a girl. you know.
so much pain.
so. you're a soldier. fighting for whom.
you go naked. something about the field generated by a living organism. nothing dead will go.
yes but i don't want to leave. i think this guy's following me.
that stuff's two hours cold.
projections were far too optimistic.
our e.p.s. was one fifty last quarter. we're up eight cents per share.
the stock will turn.
because it's fair. give me next quarter. if you still feel this way vote your shares
you're talking tomorrow. today is what counts.
you want to know what it is. what it's all about. john. chapter nine. verse twenty-five.
you mean the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself .
i'm sorry about this
see you around.
it was a gift from my brother.
don't even think about it.
read what it says: warning do <u>not</u> attempt to open. if elevator stops use emergency 
the maitre d' called you christine.
goodnight christy. it was nice meeting you.
take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
how. how could they have gotten anything.
my name's not christine. it's not my real
who is it.
what the fuck are you .
guess you missed it.
it is. it's what you hired us for. nobody touched your money. nobody stole anything. they're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne all your friends it's a celebration
trust me. call that number.
this isn't an escort service.
will you.
i thought you'd like this. best thing i ever did. if you don't want to do it don't
how do you mean exactly.
everything. i'm a goddamn human-pinata
really.
do you know how to change a tire.
no it doesn't. those keys were put there. i didn't even know
really.
yes.
what happened to you nick. i mean look at yourself
the last few days um i've been thinking had a lot of spare time. i want to tell you i'm starting to understand why you left me. i've been resenting you for it maybe but i want to apologize for all of it. for shutting you out for not being there. i anyway i hope you can forgive me.
i'll explain someday.
i'm tired of dealing with peons. i need to get to whoever's in charge.
drive in.
where.
i've been so lonely.
the key.
did the alarm go off. the house they you didn't see .
i'm just like him.
no.
don't ask.
uh nell vance
welcome home eleanor. welcome home. i've never been here. who did this.
and this is my assistant mary lambretta.
sure.
you used the wrong test.
nell.
and after she was thrown out she needed a job.
so smell is smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories. and a memory can trigger a smell.
what.
that. that's hill house.
are you mister dudley the caretaker.
no one could. no one lives any nearer than town.
a monster. but he built this for the woman he loved like the taj mahal.
is it over.
why.
i'll take that as a compliment. in the city what kind of place do you live in.
marrow said the same thing as last night he <u>says</u>  that he checked with mrs. dudley. and he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the west wing connect to the main chimney. he says that he thinks that the flue was open and with the windstorm he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current 
then who is. come on nell. deep down if you really thought it wasn't jim why wouldn't you be leaving right this second. why wouldn't you be afraid. really afraid.
i don't think i want any.
i <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
you demand to be served. a fork fetishist.
i like the colors.
we think someone is here.
how they goin' kid.
as it happens. i didn't make that part up.
and where is this guest. don't they want to interview him.
you broke last time.
huh.
been to the boat show.
i can take care of the paperwork.
this bloke she was bunked up with. this terry what'sit.
valentine. what's he got to say for himself.
y'what.
i go to work try to keep my life together put all that shit behind me man. what d'you want from me.
not me man.
you hadda show up on a weekend. this weekend. wouldn't've even been a gun show for another month.

why didn't you just kill him you had the chance.
didn't get it.
you just cooking then.
had a feeling it was you.
why did you come here.
it's been a while.
in any case i don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
said it went on for donkey's years.
modelling.
footloose and fancy free.
no i had some other matters to attend to you know. getting a car sorted 
the address jenny gave me that wasn't a prison was it.
lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing. like me but on a grander scale of failure.
i see.
what do you think.
you think terry gave me access to her things. probably sold her clothes.
you mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
 they want southern i do southern they want midwest i do midwest they want tall blonde and twenty-two i'm shit out of luck. one thing i can't do is english. americans can't. shouldn't even try. and laurence olivier couldn't do us.
what'd your father do.
how far.
you can't count on very many people that's the trouble. number of times a decent job's been cocked up 
but if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you that must make us pals.
what i like about ian he believes in a chain of command but not a chain of respect you understand what i'm saying.
you'll be looking forward to getting back then.
so what.
what d'you mean any happier.
well we blew it didn't we. he ain't wrong.

hell i i'm not proud of it. but uh that's not the worst of it. i got a note. a blackmail note. you know come across or everybody knows.
why don't you just pay him dave.
mm.
dave.
just coffee.
where you going.
my books used to be perfect. anyone could open them up make sense of the whole goddamn store.
look i don't wanna waste your time so i'll eat while we talk. ya mind. *you* don't mind. so while i'm in town i'll be staying at the hotel metropole the turandot suite. yeah it's goofy the suites're named after operas; room's ok though i poked around. i'm having 'em hold it for me on account of i'll be back and forth. in addition to my retainer you're paying hotel living expenses secretarial private eye if we need to make inquiries headshrinker should we go that way. we'll talk about appeals if as and when. for right now has she confessed.
you've gotta give me something to work with. freddy riedenschneider is good but he's not a magician. he can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. look. look at what the other side is gonna run at us. they got the company books prepared by you*cooked* by youthat's motive. they got a murder scene *you* had access to. that's opportunity. they got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat witha *dame's* weapon
yeah.
bert's ok sure he's a good man. i won't kid you though ed nobody around here has any experience with this kind of er and i hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from sacramento. capital offense. taking it seriously hmm
probity.
huh.
huh.
i don't know how it keeps on coming. it just keeps growing.
you don't got a headache.
uh-huh.
barber right. i'm freddy riedenschneider. hungry. they tell me the chow's ok here. i made some inquiries.
ok boys which of you gets the privilege.
we're just closing friend.
uh you're under arrest.
why not.
i'm telling you something's wrong. i still haven't heard from pendergast. i think you should call it off.
battery's dead. shit.
in this violent world i believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
call me vince.
did you read about a boat that washed up outside of new orleans about four months ago. twelve bodies on board.
i've got to admit that was a damn sight better than the dog ate my homework.
pendergast. help. it's right behind us.
i smell it. it's here.
did you hear that. my god. he says that mbwun is real.
pardon my french but bull shit.
what happened.
it's still back there.
all right. kawakita cover the rear.
what's that.
the thalamus and the hypothalamus perhaps.
my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
this isn't a death sentence. greg has promised to teach me fly fishing. i'll garden. i'll write.
i'm not sure. as you know the kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct. this could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
nocturnal. external hair and bony plates. locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers. reduced optic chiasm poor eyesight. external mucoid nasal glands very keen scent morphological characteristics: highly robust. aggressiveness: extreme.
and it's hungry. it's been two days since it's eaten. there are five hundred people arriving right now. the animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell. all those people in one enclosed space
we can't. we've managed to get inside the one place that's safe. i think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements. if we go outside we're risking more lives. you have to accept it margo there's nothing we can do. the building must be swarming with police by now. it won't take long for them to get through the doors.
something tried to get into this room.
read it out loud.
the dogs have lost the scent mr. pendergast. maybe we should head back.
for once i'm glad you're rumor central. what in the world is going on.
pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains.
eats them.
dr. whittlesley was last seen in belem venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. a taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat. that boat washed up in my district. everyone on board was killed.
how did you know that.
i don't know.
they're all heavily armed.
it's not supernatural. mbwun is an animal. part lizard part human a genetic freak of some kind like the half-goat half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of vietnam.
but what can we do. our guns are useless 
for what.
i can't.
i want to book a flight to fiji.
it's the busy season.
yes everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe food products to the very homes they live in
there's nothing on the show i don't use myself.
who are you.
a show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
<i>a show.</i> then who am i.
what's he doing.
they removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
how can they have a child.
well what do you want to do.
i'm thinking of getting out marlon.
truman you know i did think about moving away one time.
i figured what's the point. i knew i'd just be taking my problems with me. once the kids came along it made me look at seahaven with new eyes. i realized what the hell could be better than this. i'm telling you. what you really need is someone to carry on the burbank name.
sure. it's halogen. shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued. you coming for a drink.
i've got to talk to you.
there's no point in trying to explain it but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere people talking about me on the radio you know what i mean.
i figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
what's the hurry.
blocked at every turn. beautifully synchronized don't you agree.
no. you said do something. who were you talking to. tell me.
when you get to fiji.
leak at the plant. they had to shut her down.
who.
they're going to stop me talking to you.
how do you know about that.
and your teacher said you're too late truman. there's nothing left to explore.
good. good.
poopy day.
yup.
does what.
i hope to. we're working to develop this evidence 
no. nowe need to try our vaccine on it.
feds are looking for him too. real nice business he's got huh.
i'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. maybe something from the fema offices where the bodies were found.
i'm on the roof.
i think they have that covered.
where are you mulder.
scully.
they have divided us mulder. they're splitting us up.
i wake you.
no.
what are you implying scully.
go home mulder. it's late.
mulder what are you doing.
you're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. that this man didn't die from an explosion or from flying debris.
mulder this is going to take some time and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here. i'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
what kind of infection.
mulder 
cool in here. temperature's being regulated.
what. what's wrong.
i can mulder. i debated whether or not to even tell you in person because i knew 
what. what happened.
scully
i think you're in anaphylactic shock 
scully 
about what.
but it's not the lives we saved. it's the lives we didn't.
 if they want someone to blame they can blame me. agent scully doesn't deserve this.
i breached protocol. i broke contact with the s.a.c. i ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
why are you telling me this.
and if it doesn't. by cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise. our ignorance was in cooperating with the colonists at all.
we've allowed this man his freedom. his books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. has he outlived his usefulness to us.
he hates me.
miriam
i'd be there for him.
i don't need them anymore
there's always a chance they'll confess.
i realize that
the soul. the spirit. whatever you want to call it.
with stargher i saw things
remember julia hickson is priority number one. nothing else matters. find out where she is.
when did he lapse into the coma.

agent novak.

i don't have to.
don't understand what harry saw in a fellow like that.

i don't think so.
big.

so on one you are rich on another poor. on one you are a murderer on another the victim.
woman bites chicken leg turns out to be a mouse. or a rat. it's an urban myth.
so there's an urban myth well more of a rural myth going around here at the moment. it's about a beach.

i rest my case. he's a jewish nazi. he always was.

carla. it's me dannydanny balint. we met at that[meeting at your house.]
shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
i thought we agreed no anti- semitismit's exactly what we're trying to put behind us. trash the blacks fine; but
you wouldn't announce it.
i agree.
the jews are different. blacks are disgusting and inferior but it's like criticizing a retarded child. the jews area poison in the human well.
and jewish men like to get it.
so fine it's not that the jew the jews own the media and the banks. it's that they're sexually corrupt.
of course they're jews.
it's slander. it's reckless disregard. i'll sue you and your fucking jew paper.
what were you following me.

they don't say it to me.
sure.
who.
the death card - -
see you tomorrow —-
pedro is waiting for me too.
it's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of indians was wiped out by the conquistadores back in the 17th century a band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
yes. i want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
of course. it's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
charlie and i were talking. that's one reason i wanted to see you.
don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit.
couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him.
of course. only i'm afraid you'll be cheated. there isn't much of a view of the procession here.
i thought they came right past here ——
that's a fact isn't it.
look kicks have i ever done anything to hurt you.
no —— not yet.
who was the other man.
you're positive of that aren't you.
i know teresa -—
ain’t nobody out there mister.
i’m afraid they are out at the moment sir.
i work here sir. i’m here most of the time.
appearances can be deceptive mrs de moraes.
i’m afraid i have bad news mr de moraes. i have reason to believe your brother’s in trouble.
the question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything mrs de moraes.
you watched the tape. friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes mrs de moraes. they’re in the import-export business. they run hotels here in london which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
huh. really. hotels.
i’m really sorry you were not called
tell me did he kill his little victims too.
kids are not your thing deborah. you’d have been ready for me when i turned up with ‘sleeping beauty’. damn it. then too i should have paid more attention. “not leon” you said. it struck me at the time but obviously not hard enough. you didn’t say ‘my god.’ or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing uncle henry misbehaved. “not leon.” who then. you sure were right about one thing deborah the job was too formidable for me. i should have thought a little more before i left for los angeles. but there i was focused so hard on friedman i’d stopped thinking. nothing added up - leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping friedman into selling him a little boy you sure were right. the job was too formidable for me. but you knew that didn’t you.
why did you send me after friedman. to atone for your sins.
i didn’t know my husband and friedman knew each other. i just do you think we spoke about it. i’ve known for five years. he’s known i’ve known for five years but not once have we spoken about it. there are things one just doesn’t speak about
what was the idea. husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed.
do you think we’d let him get away with the murder of my brother.
the staff don’t know yet i called my parents told them everything i just couldn’t take any more
what do you suggest.
penrhyndeudraeth north wales.
yeah. goodnight emily.
we’re both thinking the same thing right.
what about an untrained pup white
who are you.
yes. friedman’s the fuckin’ austrian.
i don’t know this is just a delivery place man. i swear i don’t know where the kids are i work for martin that’s all. martin knows. he works for friedman. he knows
does mr gluck call for his messages.
piss off.
didn’t you say i came recommended. that’s what i thought. may i know by whom.
i didn’t mean to imply you did mrs spitz.
any friends.
the £1000 is on account.
why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography mrs spitz.
the room’s yours for 24 hours. it’s sound- proofed stocked up with food drink and other things you might find useful. you can do anything you like.
let’s go.
it’s about the puppy. you got the money.
will you be alone. the merchandise. is it just you or
this is private property. the public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
shut up. where’s your wallet.
should i be.
leon’s not here. how did you get here. phil doesn’t know where i live.
good reasons.
that’s what he said. i tried to dissuade him told him i couldn’t take on another child that he’d get into trouble i mean people who sell children but he wasn’t listening i guess he finally found himself a crusade his family think he’s back on drugs eh. huh leon did drugs. a lot of drugs. went through his self-destruct phase you know. things to come to terms with. demons to fight some people’s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. not leon’s. he did beat the drug though. he did.
they’re german jews. came here before the war. they both lost all their families in extermination camps but they themselves never went near one. the idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting leon. it’s not guilt more of a curse and then there’s something about his parents being involved with nazi hunters but i think that’s just one of leon’s dark delusions
you sure. what about before he turned up with the boy.
los angeles.
i take it you don’t know where he is then.
huh. you could always try suicide bridge. you don’t know leon do you.
who. i don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about sunshine.
why did you kill him.
what you gonna do. kill me.
moreau. c’est moi. alors
we have to do something before she tries it again. i beg of you my lord don't let her down let me organize an escape

jeanne calm down. you can't blame the people they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
well
yes. yes i'm fine we need more brushwood. why are you staring at me like that.
but how do you know what you hear is the truth.
the truth is always simple it's you jean who's making things complicated.
no but
did you come back to marry me or to insult me.
i i don't understand
jeanne's alive.
but i promised jeanne we'd fight on.
is it true that you launched an attack on paris.
and didn't you order the citizens of paris to surrender the city in the name of the king of heaven.
i can't read.
do you have a sword.
yes but
don't worry about me just stay in here and don't move.
but where are you going to be.
i will hear you but not now not here.

and your duke. the duke of bedford.
not so well i regret to say. this business with the maiden it's caused him endless grief and torment. that's why he's entrusted me with the task of shall we say
mmmm. yes. i know for example the sickness that plagues your heart. i know how painful it is for you to have loved a father without ever knowing if he really was yours.
ah jeanne come here. this whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco nothing is ready
get them out of here.
your majesty i urge you not to see this woman. it all reeks of a burgundian trap.
my dear loyal tremoille i know i can count on you
when you saw your king for the first time was there an angel over his head.
his face.
i'm more interested in what he says not what he looks like.
but if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel or a man how would you recognize him. by what he said.
wait wait
because if they don't i'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever.
and what does jeanne think.
clear.
you look disappointed isn't this what you wanted.
jeanne if you don't mind i'll stay standing this armor it's a nightmare to get back up
no.
what are you doing out here.
i i'm leaving i can't take anymore
they're going to come and visit you in here.
god asked you to do something.
in his name.
let all who love me follow me where does god get mentioned. come on jeanne be honest. you fought for yourself in your name.
why are you doing this to me. do you get pleasure from hurting me.
because because i don't know what else to do to please him.

i didn't know you were in the certificate business.

i treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
they're going to start the final resettlement now. we know what it means. we sent someone out. zygmunt. a good man. his orders were to follow the trains out of warsaw. he got to sokolow. a local railwayman told him the tracks are divided one branch leading to treblinka. he said every day freight trains carrying people from warsaw forked to treblinka and returned empty. no transports of food are ever seen on that line. and civilians are forbidden to approach the treblinka station. they're exterminating us. won't take them long. we're sixty thousand left. out of half a million. mostly young people. and this time we're going to fight. we're in good shape. we're organised. we're prepared.

there's a satellite call for you.
i told you you wanted to take this call.
so this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
honestly cal if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
i was leaning way over to see the ah propellers. and i slipped and i would have gone overboard and mr. dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
i see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.

i don't know the steps.
that was a long one. my father used to say that whenever you saw one it was a soul going to heaven.
cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.

a piece of advice mr. bond: don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton. it's deadlier than uranium.
by the way - what is it that brings you to kuala lumpur mister bond.
although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
they're merely tools to disseminate information.
you see mr. bond you and i are both men of action. but your era is passing. words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. and make no mistake about it: in the right hands they can be as deadly as your walther ppk.
q. how are you.
don't you think you're overreacting.
oh james. i've missed you -
plastique explosive shoelaces. cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
i see
a wedding band what am i supposed to be able to do with this.

your bankers want an answer about the brazilian tv stations

you always got the best of it around here and when dad always talks about my son it is always you so you fix the roof.
i'm cold. i need to get out into the sunlight.
i want sunny to have an advantage that you and i never had but he needs discipline and you are not helping when i tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
what is a sip of coffee going to do.
he is just being like all parents concerned about the ones they love.
like muddy waters.
it was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
it was nip and tuck.
doesn't he look a whole of lot better.
i need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
i'm going back home with harry.
don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. did he die.

i could swear i heard my son call me.
this would be a bad time for me to leave.
not anymore not in the city.
my mind plays tricks on me. is it okay if i take a bath now.
you all act like two roosters.
what did you put on it.
my feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
you remember that boy who lost his mind joe. you could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. he wouldn't miss a one. make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. he would pick up a brick and say go on in there brick and hit somebody and it would find its mark.
hattie is a different person now.
there is something that i always wanted to know. tell me how did those boys die.
i think if anybody had a hand in killing hocker you ought to ask or you should have asked emory and chick.

hi ya fellas. to infinity and beyond.
it's too short. we need more monkeys.
this is it. this is it. quiet quiet quiet.
somebody's poisoned the water hole
hey slinky.
i can manage.
he's a pyjama case really.
i did like the music.
is there anything else i should know about him.
he made that. in his off hours.
she'll have to learn.
is that all.
you're not so old yourself.
well yes. all right. but -
so did i.
so had i.
juliet who.
one thing bothers me that kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him. serious amounts. he's lucky he lived. so i gotta ask: what's your daughter on.
he never came home last night. was he with you.
how much.
helena i'm so sorry 
have you gone crazy. you are not carl. you aren't as good as carl. they are moving the trial to a high security location. the press has gone berserk. the jury will be influenced. stay out of things. let us try to win the case.
so you know we put the case before the arbitration panel none of whom had any expertise. superfund is just one of those words. people stop paying attention.
this is different.
no i don't think so. leave me alone give me money. that's what i get from our daughter. she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
i'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
did you tell dad.
not yet.
how. supportive letters from prison while i'm being kicked out of our home. do you have any idea what is happening out here. our credit cards are maxed. the people at the bank you should see their faces when i walk in there. i have a letter from the government telling me that anything i sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien. our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging. nobody will help us. nobody will take us in. nobody wants anything to do with us. so tell me carl how you're gonna make it up to me. tell me again how we'll get through this and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
yes.
i volunteer. i read to blind people. one day a week for two hours.
what's that mean.
i have dreams about this actual dreams about busting the top people the rich people the white people.
maradona is a cokehead. hand of god my ass. we're wasting our time here.
you can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff. three categories: you like me you hate me you want something from me. definitely third category.
all the professionals keep them in the trunk.
you're kidding. can't you shoot him or something.
you want to smuggle narcotics in mr. espastico jacobo. that's nothing new.
take this back with you. deliver it safely to tigrillo in san diego and we have a deal.
an informant.
does this offer include my partner.
i'm curious how you did this with such economy.
it's possible.
the busiest land border crossing in the world. over forty-one thousand vehicles per day twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot. i think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
that triple the amount of stuff is going through.
what.
let me ask you a related question. we've talked about the supply side but what about demand. what is your policy for treating addiction.
i'll get there as soon as i can.
who do we interface with on their side.
the cards. the last thing i said to you was mind the cards.
i'll be right after you.
you've stabbed me man.
do you find that this approach usually works or let me guess you've never tried it before. in fact you don't normally approach girls am i right. the truth is that you're a quite sensitive type but if i'm prepared to take a chance i might just get to know the inner you: witty adventurous passionate loving loyal a little bit crazy a little bit bad but hey don't us girls just love that.
christ i haven't felt that good since archie gemmill scored against holland in 1978.
because it's illegal.
easy for you to say.
i read it in cosmopolitan.
actually it's a nightmare. i've been desperate for a shag but watching him suffer was just too much fun. you should try it with tommy.
exactly. i'm not wanting a cat she says. get to fuck right. so there's tommy stuck with this kitten. you can imagine what happened. the thing was neglected pissing and shitting all over the place. tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. he didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
nightmare.
goldfinger's better than dr. no. both of them are a lot better than diamonds are forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office in which field of course thunderball was a notable success.
i would say in those days he was a muscular actor in every sense with all the presence of someone like cooper or lancaster but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead closer in that respect to cary grant.
roald dahl.
so who else.
i don't rate that at all.
yeah beautifully fucking illustrated.
oh no don't even mention it.
i got a good price for it. rents i need the money.
that's fair enough.
yes but then she finds out i've bought a ticket for iggy pop the same night.
i love people. all people. even people that no one else loves i think they're ok you know. like beggars.
then i shall make use of this starship.
don't tell them you're lost. you'll never live it down.
what's going on.

what's to think about.
get it straight lee isn't into taking risks. he deals with a couple of guys and he's been dealing with them for years. they're reliable. they're dependable. and they're safe.

i don't believe you.
i'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. where did they go.

he's drugged out of his mind. he's completely zoned out.

no not really. it'sit's in my mind. like you said.
james you said he was hiding in the barn
you had a bullet from world war one in your leg james. how did it get there.
no superiors. no scientists. no people from the future. it's just a carpet cleaning company. they have voice mail you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
it's private.
bulishit. you're fucking with my head.
jose.
hey man
i said it was bad judgment. what else do you want me to say.
kathryn you know he can't possibly know that. you're a rational person. you're a trained psychiatrist. you know the difference between what's real and what's not.
you're insane jeffrey.
please tell me jeffrey what exactly are you going to do. i don't have to tell you i'm afraid.
ex-psychiatrist. now what about flashlights. how many flashlights.
lost my eyes on okinawa. lost them fighting the war. fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
you sure got a lot of philosophy old man.
we was born to die boy. from the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head. you just don't know where or when or how. don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
it is not.
and what are you. a rocket scientist.
we have a bus to mexico. arrives in two hours. have to make a couple of connections but it will get you across the border.
twenty-seven fifty. that's all i got.
accident.
you got to be more careful. i remember one time
just banged my head. it was an accident.
hundred-fifty.
no charge.
two-hundred.
take it. as soon as i get my money. fifty dollars for an almost new gasket. you don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
what's it to you.
i don't want no dirty money. i run an honest business.
we ain't got no beck's.
i had a fight with jake. i i just wanted to get away for awhile. mr. stewart was kind enough to take me as far as montrose. i'm going to take a bus to my sister's. i thought i'd stay with her for a few days.
is that the way you want it boy. a bullet in the head in the middle of the desert. ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
. . .at the very least. i know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars. now how much did you get.
they look nice.
you didn't hear something.
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
do you have to call me that.
my cup runneth over beauti
what happened to your hand.
oh this isn't my car. it's down a ways. i should have parked closer. i just didn't think it would be so heavy. i could drive up.
yes i have.
least you can leave.
where you coming from.
all over. chicago miami detroit. just lately albuquerque.
those are white words not ours.
beautiful.
i like them. i was sick of looking at this room. i think they add a little life.
still playing.
yeah i guess you're right.
you think jake's going to give me money just so i can take you out of here.
he's got money. in a floor safe in the living room. i've never seen it but he talks about it all the time. more like brags. he loves his money. wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
yeah a bird in a gilded cage.
lied. what do you mean.
it's not like he's a young man. he's had time to live.
i thought you would be on your way to vegas by now. is there something you wanted.
why. am i making you hot or does the truth scare you.
i thought you couldn't leave. i thought you couldn't get your car.
i'm not sure where it is. not exactly. i never saw it. i just heard him talk about it.
it's got to be here. i heard him talk about it. he bragged about it. six steps out three left.
there's easily a hundred-thousand in there. more than that.
yeah. good thinking.
but you said we could be together.
are you kidding. i'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
<u>we</u> killed jake. and it's a big difference. you kill an old man that's one thing. nobody cares about an old man. you kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. never.
i swear to you that's all that happened. i haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
i have half a mind to
live there.
why would i kill her.
just ran into a little trouble.
i'm surprised to see you. i thought you'd be halfway to vegas by now.
i did.
and what does that make you.
no.
i hate loving her. i hate the kind of her person she is. i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays. i hate letting her use me. but i love her too much to do otherwise. and i certainly love her too much to kill her. i couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. but you. you got the killing in you boy.
wait a minute. just listen to me
and then with jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars. or maybe two-thousand. or twenty-thousand. who's to stop you. not jake mckenna 'cause old jake would be dead.
is that what happened. did you even make it out to the desert or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets.
i've had time to get over it.
you're not from around here are you. where you from.
you're too late toby. we're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
toby tyler it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off and i'm gonna have his love child.
fine. i was making time with your girl. now i'm all scared and i'll never make that mistake again. now go away.
john what a surprise. i expected to be seeing you not talking to you over the phone.
a hundred-forty-five really.
do you understand me you little fuck.
i think you might just want to do as i say.
eh.
don't call me old man. ain't you got no respect boy.
just 'cause i ain't got eyes doesn't mean i can't see.
musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. this town's all inbreeding.
that's not the way it looked to me. looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
let's seethey're not very imaginative.
mister.
i'm leaving. you never have to see me again. just please give me the ticket.
what the fuck do you want.
oh. darrell taking good care of you.
talk. about what.
sweet grace. what about her.
i do.
i'm not rambling.
come to think of it how 'bout some money upfront.
hey mister. you gotta quarter for the juke.
you like patsy cline. i just love her. how come i wonder she don't put out no more new records.
harlin around.
well you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself.
hey.
to replace a goddamn radiator hose.
i don't know but it's the reason i'm living here and you're just passing through. now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
i don't have a goddamn credit card.
one of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started.
listen darrell about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car as soon as i get where i'm going i swear i'll
i don't give a fuck. i didn't tell you to do it. you can't just do unauthorized work.
what the fuck did you do to my trunk.
what you want.
open up.
no.
i got it.
i just drove in this morning.
you've been around.
i didn't say it bothered me.
nice place.
what do you do anyway.
where'd you learn to do that.
a medicine man.
i'm guessing no.
i don't know how.
it's not that easy. maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please. i can't. i don't want to be alone. i need to know i'm going to be taken care of.
honey baby i <u>can't</u>. i can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. believe it or not i need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic
why. am i making you hot or does the truth scare you.
i thought you couldn't get your car.
i came back for you; this morning i came back. before i even knew about the money. you're what i want. the only reason i stormed off is because you spooked me talking about jake. but i've had nothing but time to think about it. it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. but we've got to get the money baby. we get the money i get the car then we get the hell out.
grace grace.
hawaii. i've read all about it. i've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. oh god. i'd kill to go there.
he was in love with you grace. he would've done what you wanted you could've made a deal and 
don't you want to know. i bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now.
you don't believe in anything do you bobby.
that's a nasty cut you got there.
what'd you say to me.
but in particular.
shasta. now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that. sorry about that mister. let's see you want $3.25. you try to have a nice day now would you.
you fuck this guy get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me.
goddamnit virgil stop. don't.
yes yes hit mebeat me please.
yeah i heard a key slapping against my ass.
whoa what kind of accent you got there. you one of them russians.
what did i say.
yes.
maybe it wasn't a specific moment maybe it
you've never been sick.
what's he talking about.
at the church you were following me weren't you.
why is it do you think that of all the professions in the world you chose protection.
okay i don't want to play this game anymore.
stop messing with my life elijah. my son almost shot me last night. he wanted to prove you were right.
i am. i'm helping him with the sale.

shut up alice. little bill a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
damaged property. like if i was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
you figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
she could maybe clean up around the place or somethin' but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
i didn't hear nothin' till last night.
you could run off them two cowboys.
the duck of death.
but he was called
well that bullet whizzin' by panicked corky an' he done the wrong thing. pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. meantime bob aims good and squeezes off another but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. well now the duck of death is good as dead 'cause this time corky does right an' aims real good no hurry
they they killed him. i thought you know that. i thought you knew because
the questions little bill asked him what sort of questions was they.
what'd ned say.
didn't scare little bill though did it.
oh.
well now kid there's two of these cowboys ain't that so. better there's three of us maybe them cowboys got friends. maybe

we'll bury him.
an' if i spot 'em.
i'll ride up close an' shoot 'em.
we know but our man says no way on the dope. this hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for turkey the next' day. they had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
keyser soze
i'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by monday.
they want more time to think about investing.
they ruined me tonight.
i know who he is.
come on. the guy is a pipe dream. this kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
don't move you fuckers.
i know you. you don't think i know you're on the take. this whole fucking precinct is dirty. you don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
i wanted to talk to you. the other guys -
don't hurt me.
some guy in california. his name is redfoot.
i'11 be alright.
fenster and hockney.
don't do this. send her a card - something.
keaton i can't just -
don't jerk me off. we all know what this is. you don't work with me if i work with you without knowing who i'm working for. now let's cut the shit. who's the man.
what about redfoot.
when does he post bail.
he won't go into the interrogation room.
someplace else then.
even if i was to let you talk to him he won't talk to you. he's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
no no no no no.
oh i know. sweet deal you have. total immunity .
he didn't have my lawyer.
heartwarming. really i feel weepy.
there was a lawyer. kobayashi.
came from redfoot.
where's your head agent kujan. where do you think the pressure's coming from. keyser soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where i am right now. he's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. immunity was just to deal with you assholes. i got a whole new problem when i post bail.
so why play into his hands. we can protect you.
this is totally irrelevant.
oh but it's not. if i hadn't been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets i never would have took off for new york. i never would have met keaton see. that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
what call.
wait a minute.
this is all bullshit.
where are you going to go verbal. you gonna run. turn states evidence. you might never see trial. if somebody wants to get you you know they'll get you out there.
yes.
how good's your intelligence.
this is a nuisance suit. he's looking for small change. he's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
no. absolutely and we're going to see that it is not.
that was our insurance company's recommendation.
i was her doctor.
well many reasons actually
well we
yes.
to get her heartbeat back.
almost nine minutes causing brain damage.
i'm sure it is but this is massachusetts doctor. certified in internal medicine.
neurology.
what book is that.
`methodology and techniques of anesthesiology.' yes.
mr. concannon.
it's a crime.
i wouldn't do it.
you would not.
in fact you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. you've just sworn to that. isn't that right.
iyes.
that's not my handwriting.
what is this going to cost.
hold on a second.
if i could accept the offer right now i would. they took it back.
that's what the sister said. the chart said she ate nine hours prior to
'code blue'
i have some errands to run and then i thought we'd spend the evening
that's what i'd planned to
cardiac arrest. during delivery her heart stopped. when the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. you get brain damage. that is why she's in the state she's in today.
i could subpoena him if i had a week.
ready your honor.
galvin look many years ago
mr. galvin's
hello i'm calling from
yes. price
and what are you. a cop.
the weak the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. isn't that the truth. you want another drink.
they might. yes. that's the point is that they mightyou see the jury wants to believe. they're all cynics sure because they want to believe. i have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.  i'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. and every one of them it's written on their face `this is a sham. there is no justice' but in their heart they're saying 'maybemaybe'
is this a bad time.
they uh they got to my witness.
you're like a kid you're coming in here like it's saturday night you want me to say that you've got a fever you don't have to go to school
oh yes i do joe. believe me. you say you're going to lose. is it my fault. listen. the damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you.

and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for stearns harrington and he bought a dog and everything is rosy.  then mr. stearns he tried to fix a case.
no. but one assumes obligations. my wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. her father's partner runs the company yard in the east baltimore so i decided as long as i had to work at it i'd come back here. i've always liked it here.
shouldn't you be sitting down.
how often does this happen.
more and more in the past few weeks. and she wanders. god knows where she wanders. i followed her one day.

could i ask you a couple of questions.
is this some kind of gallup poll or something.
do you live here in the hotel.
i just want to see you as much as i can.

you don't remember.
where had you been before.
will you tell me something. has this ever happened to you before.
what.
oh yes. fine. no after effects. but as i remember now that water was cold wasn't it. what a terrible thing to do and you were so kind it's a formal thank-you letter. and a great big apology.
you've nothing to apologize for.
would you like some coffee.
oh some two thousand years or more.
no birds live here.
where.
why did you jump.
take me away from here.

just wander.
but you said grey sir.
first of all
you're an asshole.
this is pathetic.
don't point at me.
you have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. you have always been a fringe player. you have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
don't you fucking threaten me - i'll fucking kill you.
just giving the facts.
we have to get going.
they're screaming for starbursts.
what.
so who's the lucky guy.
she's in the bathroomshe's still working.

you never walked away dad. you could have walked away.
harry chaplin. cats in the cradle.
well i'm in the middle of my goddamn toast here.
i'm getting married

miss viridiana 
i don't know anything about these things jorge 
but you have a right to let us know what you think.
you won't get much done with those people. those times are over. you ought to let me kick them out.

barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field remember.
how should i know.
it was you wasn't it.
sid —— no
i know. i was there. i saw the whole thing. if i was your therapist i would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
it was just like before wasn't it. wasn't it. but you are making progress. instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after this time there was only one other person involved.

yeah where's your machine gun.
 looks like you grown another inch but you don't look so hot getting bags under your eyes starting to look old like me.
you get on the phone and ask strangers for their money right. you're a salesman.
 it adds up buddy 300 here 200 there. your brother never well i always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow
problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me thanks.
wait next week's booked. let me check with my girl and get back to you on monday.
yeah you do that huckleberry. i'll still be here.
as far as being axed i'm still here and as long as i am i have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members i represent
i'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning wanting to know what's going on i'm going to lie to them.
i told him i was in the bathroom and i'd call him right back. what the hell was i supposed to say buddy you got me into
so where are we going.
how do you do mr. gekko. i'm bud fox.
can't tell you that mr. gekko.
hi sport.
see this. can you believe it. two inch screen
mr. gekko i don't think i cango on.
what about hard work.
you don't understand. i want to be surprisedastonish me sport new info don't care where or how you get it just get it my wife tells me you put a move on darien. here's some inside info for you. that euroflash gq guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. exit visas are imminent. so don't lose your place in line. oh jeez i wish you could see this. the lights coming up over the water. i've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment. an old russian proverb - a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar. i like you sport i ever tell you that gordon call me gordon from now on.
the art of which is deception. spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned
what the hell do you want.
it's all about bucks kid the rest is conversation bud you're still going to be president. and when the time comes you'll parachute out a rich man. with the money you're going to make your father won't have to work another day in his life.
believe me buddy i was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. look why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. bring darien
destiny took us apart but i knew it would bring us back together.
not really. i'd say that gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. he has a great eye and he only buys the best. like this rug for instance a silk tabriz the finest of its kind. the day after he bought it in london a dealer representing the saudi royal family offered him twice what he paid. it absolutely makes the room. see how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa although i don't know if i would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. and it's a sacrilege having that pre-columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. some dope might use it as an ashtray.
well if you're that good you could probably do wonders at my place.
upper west side.
break it.
the conference oh yeah. fine. we reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
bud i hate to tell you this but you're a genius. darienlightning has struck. the lightbulb has been invented. edison da vinci einstein are watching
that changes all my plans i thought you were loaded
talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. i handed it to him on a silver platter. i told my father and those people
come on we both like buddy. but this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top it doesn't fit.
 just got 250000 shares at 18 1/4 from janson think i'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the california pensions. we got close to half a million shares in the bag.

velcome to ve vaxverk.
that's not what you said last night.
listen sarah i think i know what's going on ok. i went to the waxwork today.i met this man.
you don't understand. i recognized his face now come on.
well it all started when a friend and i
one has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
they're all human beings
stop saying things so loud.
looks a little spooky boys you think we should do this.
no he wouldn't.
do you really think so.
isn't there something called group hysteria.
do you.
no.
of course. you must be so proud.
there was justsome tension. you were upset. i remember being concerned.
well i'm glad. pardon my intrusiveness but we do have to stick together you know.
tell me. please.
for scaring you like i did. when i thought about what that must have seemed like that day
and then you weren't there.
love.
mrs. frank.
sounds about right. never understood how a girl that wild got all a's. sure didn't get it from me. they wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young. maddie wouldn't hear about it.

seance.
nothing. it wasn't anything. i've been on edge lately. maybe since the accident. and i'd prefer i really would to just
i started to walk overbut he wasn't alone. a blond. i only caught a glimpse. she was young. i should have said something right away. but i didn't.
partly because i didn't want to hurt youbut partlypartly because i was relieved.
by the time i finally got up the nerve to tell you stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
i don't know
did she say that.
oh.
of perpetual distances. everybody's checking their shoelaces. pins drop. i'm afraid you've mistaken me i say
right. and why is she here. if he killed her why doesn't she haunt him.
i never said
how do you know this.
who did.
jody and i. and she was there norman she was. it scared jody so bad she had to leave.
ever since the accident i've been worried that you'd been unhappy or
no it's fine. i'm fine.
you were lost in the musiceyes closedyour chest heaving

no. i'm afraid to ask what this is about.
the
i'm positive this time
ow.
who.
what did you think i would do. jesus christ. i gave up my life and my music
that's not true. you wanted to quit. and then when you did you hated me for it so you gave it all to her.
what.
nothing.
i did not. i did not kill anyone. jesus. claire listen to me. i walked in and she was lying there dead. i swear to you. on my life. she took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me. to destroy us. if i hadn't stopped by here before school the painters would have

angel

i wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight.
so far away. in xenia.
get them together.
we don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. but hey if you think there's a market for it.
we reinvented ourselves.
you've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar italian loafers.
that explains the emptiness that haunts me.
not bad for a hack. he has a future in yellow journalism.
i don't like you. we're just friends.
hi teddy bear.
i thought i'd be nervous but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed teddy bear.
i remember spring break of my senior year. seems like a lifetime ago.
son.
i guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
i know they were simple people but did this trip help your college fund at all.
sorry i
it's okay. you need me.
shut your pie hole jimmy.
oh sweetheart. we wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you.
and the girl i love she hates heaven. if i keep it she'll never respect me.
if you could just sign right there.
don't even tell me you're hot for miss titty pom poms over there.
i didn't know they gave them for best lip gloss retention during a blow job.
in the sense that there is no hidden agenda behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
what do you want from me. i'm trying to be fair. but i can't keep you on staff if you turn every pta meeting into an agent orange cover up.
me.
you're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
where are we going.
i can't believe your dad built this for you.
whatever.
not whatever. it's two different things.
cut to the chase william randolph. your audience is way ahead of you.
he's on the move.
i got an anonymous tip and an address in cincinnati.
you expected whips chains merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood.
come on.
maybe someday.
i know their small town mentality can be maddening.
i mean your pictorial. it bothers me profoundly.
you're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
very ambitious. i like that.
save it honey. we want to hear every detail when you get back but we don't want you to run up mr. zukerman's phone bill.
what is all this. when are you coming home.
oh good lord. are those neptunes.
you don't have to work another day in your lives.
are you kidding. this magazine is my dream. it's every red-blooded heterosexual male's dream.
have you ever even looked at heaven.
as much as possible.
just a couple of finishing touches. my parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
huh. you laugh in the face of pressure.
i was like a different person tonight.
you are home. but go ahead finish school do what you feel you need to do. in the meantime i'll be your point person here on the magazine.
i never finished school myself. never had to. my brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. he gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. i never struggled for a second.
wellfor one thingi think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of classic beauty.
at our press conference tomorrow i think we should announce our plans to explore the world. not just a few leggy 36d's with blond hair upstairs and down.
my father must've been amazing.
i never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
i owe it all to you. without your help i'd be lost.
what are you doing.
all is fair in heaven ted-baby.
oh no. no way. i've had all the bad news i can take for one day.
my parents. what do you mean.
how quaint.
kelly.
wasn't enough van ryan had to destroy the people who invested here. he got to be old he and his rich cronies would come down here hunt and whore act like assholes. one trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp. that came with her.
and the child
i just want to get it over with. my mom's making me do this. i just want to forget it.
you mean he withdrew
i don't know what to say
it's our job gloria.
this is where she lives. she wants to talk. beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all. i busted her once for possession. she wound up doing about six months at camp nine.
think back before the suit was filed before the trial. lombardo had an affair with sandra right. so why not tell us about the affair. i mean it could be a hell of a motive for kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
it's starting gloria. this is how it begins
her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away. and i found the car at the miami bus terminal.
you didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
did he come in with you.
just tell us what happened.
i told her i was coming with her. she nodded like she understood. we stood up together.
you guess. did he or didn't he.
he pushed into me i couldn't stop him it hurt.
ms. toller.
you know i want to thank you for getting me into this class no way was my old man going to spring for the fees
i can't believe you called sam. what's the matter with you.
you're out of your mind.
jeez that thing can't you
i'm really serious. that cop he keeps watching me.
forget it.
can't you take that stupid thing off.
you're saying that kelly was raped by sam lombardo.
you can't
i had to go look for this coupon.
fuck you. this is bullshit. i'm outta here.
yeah well you fixed that. what the hell happened anyway.
did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little suzie toller to death with a wine bottle. jesus man. it couldn't have worked out better. they're convinced kelly whacked suzie. i can't talk 'em out of it. we should be celebrating. this thing worked out just like you said only better.
walter. he's been aimin' that brownie through knotholes for years. i saw these i knew he'd finally struck gold. i can't decide which came out better that little straw kelly's got up her nose or that vibrator you've got up her ass. what do you think mr. lombardo.
sorry. didn't mean that. just a little device of mine
always hoping. or this
aha.
is this leading somewhere.
limestone quarry southern mansion. easy to get them mixed up i say we invite ourselves to the party.
quite. come let's mingle.
you're either having a seizure or you just said hello.
could i just point out this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
